The Baltic Scientific Instruments Si(Li) detector with Peltier cooling type SER\-25
uses the model SP350 circuit board for control of the device and to receive
external commands over a serial interface.
The instrument is
configured in \fBspec\fP as an MCA\-type device using
a serial interface.
.sp
In addition to the standard MCA functionality, the SP350 has eight
count\-rate monitors that return the counts per second in defined
channel ranges.
.SH "OPERATION"
.rs
.sp
The following \fBmca_par()\fP commands are available.
If more than one MCA
is configured, use \fBmca_sel()\fP or \fBmca_spar()\fP.  See the \fI\%mca\fP
help file for details on using multiple MCA devices.
Note, all \fBmca_par()\fP arguments below are case insensitive, that is,
upper case, lower case or mixed case letters will work.
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("clear")\fP
\- 
Sends commands to the SP350 to clear the data and counters.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("run")\fP
\- 
If \fB"auto_clear"\fP mode is set, sends commands to clear the data and counters.
Turns live\-time mode on or off, if needed, to match the current preset mode.
Sets leveling mode, shaping time, and threshold level, if needed, to match current settings
If a preset value is nonzero, programs the SP350 with the preset time.
Finally, sends the command to start acquisition.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("halt")\fP
\- 
Sends the command to halt acquisition.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("auto_clear" [, 0|1])\fP
\- 
With no arguments returns the current value of auto\-clear mode.
Otherwise turns auto\-clear mode off or on.
When auto\-clear mode is on, the data and counters are cleared automatically
each time an acquisition is started.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("auto_run" [, 0|1])\fP
\- 
With no arguments returns the current value of auto\-run mode.
Otherwise turns auto\-run mode off or on.
When auto\-run mode is on, the SP350 is started automatically with the standard
\fBspec\fP count commands.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("soft_preset" [, 0|1])\fP
\- 
With no arguments, returns the current value of soft\-preset mode.
Otherwise turns soft\-preset mode off or on.
When soft\-preset mode is on in conjunction with auto\-run mode, the SP350 will
be programmed for the same preset accumulation time as the master timer when
counting to time.
Also, \fBspec\fP will poll the SP350 for the end of
timed counting in addition to polling the master timer.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("npts" [, value])\fP
\- 
With no arguments, returns the current number of points configured for the SP350
data.  Otherwise sets the number of points to \fBvalue\fP.
Allowed values are 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 and 16384.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("group_size" [, value])\fP
\- 
Has the same meaning as \fB"npts"\fP above.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("preset" [, value])\fP
\- 
With no arguments, returns the current preset acquisition time in seconds.
Otherwise sets the preset acquisition time to \fBvalue\fP.
The SP350 is not programmed with the value until acquisition is started.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("preset_real" [, value])\fP
\- 
With no arguments, returns the current preset acquisition time in seconds.
Otherwise sets the preset acquisition time to \fBvalue\fP and sets
the acquisition mode to real time.
The SP350 is not programmed with the mode or value until acquisition is started.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("preset_live" [, value])\fP
\- 
With no arguments, returns the current preset acquisition time in seconds.
Otherwise sets the preset acquisition time to \fBvalue\fP and sets
the acquisition mode to live time.
The SP350 is not programmed with the mode or value until acquisition is started.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("real")\fP
\- 
Sets the acquisition mode to real time.
The SP350 is not programmed with the mode until acquisition is started.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("live")\fP
\- 
Sets the acquisition mode to live time.
The SP350 is not programmed with the mode until acquisition is started.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("elapsed_live")\fP
\- 
Returns the elapsed live time in seconds of the current or most recent acquisition.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("elapsed_real")\fP
\- 
Returns the elapsed real time in seconds of the current or most recent acquisition.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("leveling" [, 0|1])\fP
\- 
With no arguments, returns 1 or 0 indicating whether leveling mode is on or off.
Otherwise turns leveling mode off or on if the argument is zero or nonzero,
respectively.
Leveling mode rejects double and triple peaks from the data.
The manufacturer recommends having leveling mode on.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("shaping_time" [, 3|6])\fP
\- 
With no arguments, returns the current shaping\-time value, which can be
either 3 or 6 microseconds.
Otherwise sets the shaping time to the argument, which must be 3 or 6.
A 3 microsecond shaping time is good for count rates up to 150 kcps.
A 6 microsecond shaping time offers better energy resolution but is
only good for count rates less than 20 kcps.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("threshold" [, value])\fP
\- 
With no arguments, returns the current threshold level.
Otherwise sets the threshold to \fBvalue\fP, which must be
from 0 to 4096.
The resolution of the value is to 0.0625 (1/16).
The threshold sets the level of background noise cut off.
.HP 5m
."

\- 
With no arguments, returns the current low\-level discriminator value.
Otherwise sets the low\-level discriminator to \fBvalue\fP, which must be
from 0 to 4096.
The resolution of the value is to 0.0625 (1/16).
The low\-level discriminator sets the low energy border for spectrum
acquisition.
