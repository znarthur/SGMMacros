.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBspec\fP supports the Ortec 974, 994, 995, 996 and 997 counter
and counter\-timer NIM
modules over both GPIB and RS\-232C interfaces.
When running the configuration editor, select from the following
descriptions on the device configuration screen to specify
which Ortec modules you are using and how you are using them:

Only one module can be selected as a counter/timer.
The 974 module can be assigned a maximum of four channels.
The 994 should be assigned two channels normally and
three channels when used as a blind timer.
The 996 should be assigned one channel normally and
two channels when used as a blind timer.
The 995 has two channels and the 997 has one.
.sp
On the scaler configuration screen, choose \fBOR9XX\fP as the controller
for all channels associated with an Ortec module.
The unit numbers selected for each channel correspond to the order
the Ortec modules appear on the device configuration screen.
When using the 994 as a blind timer, you must select channel number 2
for the timebase.
When using the 996 as a blind timer, you must select channel number 1
for the timebase.
.SH "Using the 974"
.rs
.sp
The 974 is a four\-channel counter/timer having a minimum 0.1 second time base.
You should connect the monitor counts through a tee to the
EXT IN connector on the back of module and to the
COUNTER INPUT 2 connector on the front of the module.
Use the COUNTER INPUT 3 and 4 connectors for one or two detector input
channels.
Also, make sure that the internal dip switch S\-1 has position 6 set to
one\-cycle (ON/closed).
.SH "Using the 994 As a Normal Timer"
.rs
.sp
The 994 is a two\-channel counter/timer with a minimum 0.01 second time base.
In order to obtain accurate elapsed time readings, one counter
channel is used to count time and the other is used to count monitor counts.
An additional counter, such as the 995 or 997 is normally
used to accumulate detector counts and is gated by the 994.
The monitor count source should be connected to both the IN A and IN B front
panel connectors of the 994 using a tee.
The internal jumpers W3 and W4 (located underneath the interface board)
must both be set to the TIME position (the rightmost two pins on W3, the
leftmost two pins on W4).
Jumper W1 must be set to the NORMAL position (the two rightmost pins).
Also, make sure the internal dip switch on the interface card
has position 6 set to
one\-cycle (ON), position 7 set to COUNTER/TIMER (OFF) and position 8 set
to NORMAL (ON).
Finally, make sure the front panel DWELL switch is turned all the way off.
.SH "Using the 994 or 996 as a Blind Timer"
.rs
.sp
In the blind timer mode, the 994 has the monitor counts connected to IN A and
detector counts connected to IN B.
The 996 has only one input which would be used for detector counts.
The internal jumpers W3 and W4 (for the 994) must be set
to the COUNTS position
(the leftmost two pins on W3, the rightmost two pins on W4).
Jumper W1 must be set to the NORMAL position (the two rightmost pins).
Also, make sure the internal dip switch S\-1 has position 6 set to
one\-cycle (ON), position 7 set to COUNTER/TIMER (OFF) and position 8 set
to NORMAL (ON).
Finally, make sure the front panel DWELL switch
on the 994 is turned all the way off.
.sp
When operated as a blind timer, \fBspec\fP cannot read back the elapsed time
from the module.
Instead,
the elapsed count time is estimated
from the software clock
when counting to monitor counts, when counting in powder mode,
when reading the counters during updated counting
and when counting is aborted with a \fB^C\fP.
.SH "Polling and Alarm Mode"
.rs
.sp
Initially, spec used alarm mode to detect when counting
was over, but an Ortec firmware update in the late 1990s changed the behavior of alarm
mode.
With the new firmware,
\fBspec\fP sometimes missed the end of the counting interval.
.sp
The alternative to alarm mode is to read the counter values until
the elapsed time or the preset count has reached the programmed value.
For non\-blind\-timer configurations,
\fBspec\fP stopped using alarm mode for GPIB\-interfaced units with release
4.03.10 and for serial\-interfaced units with release 5.09.1\-11.
.sp
For blind\-timer configurations,
alarm
mode isn\(aqt necessary when counting to a monitor preset, but the \fBspec\fP
Ortec support
was not updated to eliminate alarm mode in that specific configuration until
\fBspec\fP release 6.00.11\-2.
Alarm mode is still required when counting to time in blind\-timer mode.
However, when
doing updated counting (where \fBspec\fP reads the counters periodically
and where the problems with alarm mode occur most often), \fBspec\fP
checks the software clock after reading the counters.
If the elapsed time is 0.5 seconds beyond the programmed count time,
\fBspec\fP will stop the current count interval.
.SH "Gating"
.rs
.sp
An external enable signal from certain motor controllers
may be be fed into the rear\-panel gate BNC input on the 974
or the front panel enable
BNC input on the 994 for precise counter gating in powder\-mode scans.
.sp
If using a second Ortec module as a counter, you must connect the INTERVAL
BNC connector (rear panel on 974, front panel on 994) to the master GATE
on the 974 rear panel or to the ENABLE or individual GATE inputs on
the 994, 995, 996 or 997 modules.
.SH "Setting Operational Parameters"
.rs
.sp
The \fBcounter_par()\fP function can be used
to set various parameters associated with the Ortec module code in \fBspec\fP.
The first argument to \fBcounter_par()\fP is a channel number,
although all the commands affect
all channels of the associated module, or all of the Ortec modules,
if appropriate.
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBcounter_par(counter, "alarm", mode)\fP
\- 
If \fBmode\fP is zero, turns off the
alarm mode of operation of the timer, and turns on a polled mode.
If \fBmode\fP is one, alarm mode is turned on.
.sp
When alarm mode is enabled and the counter is using
a GPIB interfaces, the counter sets a special bit in the GPIB serial poll
byte at the end of counting.
On serial interfaces, the counter sends an asynchronous message containing
the count results.
.sp
The default operation used to be for alarm mode to be turned on.
However, a late twentieth century firmware update from Ortec
changed the behavior of
alarm mode such that it was no longer robust with \fBspec\fP.
Thus, alarm mode is disabled by default
except for blind\-timer mode with the 994 and 996 when
counting to a time preset.
.HP 5m
."
\fBcounter_par(counter, "alarm")\fP
\- 
Returns one if alarm mode is on.  Otherwise returns zero.
.HP 5m
."
\fBcounter_par(counter, "display", channel)\fP
\- 
Sets the counter channel that will be displayed on the associated module.
For the 974 modules, valid values for \fBchannel\fP are 1 to 4.
For the the 994 and 995 modules,
valid values for \fBchannel\fP are 0 and 1.
.HP 5m
."
\fBcounter_par(counter, "display")\fP
\- 
Returns the channel number currently being displayed.
.HP 5m
."
\fBcounter_par(counter, "local", mode)\fP
\- 
If \fBmode\fP is nonzero, will force the associated module
to go into local mode to
allow front panel operation.
In addition, the module will be placed in local mode
after each count interval.
If \fBmode\fP is zero, the module will be set to remote mode
at the start of the next
count interval, and will not be set back to local mode after counting.
When \fBspec\fP starts up, not switching to local mode
is the default behavior to minimize overhead.
.HP 5m
."
\fBcounter_par(counter, "local")\fP
\- 
Returns zero if the associated module is to be kept in remote mode.
Otherwise, returns one.
