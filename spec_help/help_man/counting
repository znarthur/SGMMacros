as given in the configuration file.
.HP 5m
."
\fBcnt_name(i)\fP
\- 
Returns the string name of counter \fBi\fP
as given in the configuration file.
.HP 5m
."
\fBcnt_num(mne)\fP
\- 
Returns the counter number corresponding
to the counter mnemonic \fBmne\fP,
or \-1 if there is no such counter configured.
.HP 5m
."
\fBcounter_par(i, s [, v])\fP
\-

Recognized values for the string \fBs\fP include:
.RS 5m
.sp
.PD 0.2v
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fB"monitor"\fP
\- 
Reassigns the scaler channel used as the monitor\-preset counter
to the channel associated with counter \fBmne\fP.
Rereading the hardware configuration file
with the \fBconfig\fP macro or \fBreconfig\fP command
will restore the monitor channel to that set in the \fBconfig\fP file.
This feature is only available with certain counters.
Counters that currently support this feature
include the KS 3640 CAMAC counter,
the Joerger VSC16/8 VME scaler and the generic EPICS scaler.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"timer"\fP
\- 
Reassigns the scaler channel used as the time\-preset counter
to the channel associated with counter \fBmne\fP.
Rereading the hardware configuration file
with the \fBconfig\fP macro or \fBreconfig\fP command
will restore the time channel to that set in the \fBconfig\fP file.
Currently no timers support this feature.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"controller"\fP
\- 
returns a string containing the controller name
of the specified counter.
The controller names are those used in \fBspec\fP\(aqs \fBconfig\fP files.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"unit"\fP
\- 
returns the unit number of the specified counter.
Each counter controller unit may contain more than one counter channel.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"channel"\fP
\- 
returns the channel number of the specified counter.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"responsive"\fP
\- 
returns a nonzero value if the counter responded
to an initial presence test or appears otherwise to be working.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"disable"\fP
\- 
returns a nonzero value if the counter has been disabled by software.
If \fBv\fP is given and is nonzero, then the counter is disabled.
If \fBv\fP is given and is zero, the counter becomes no longer disabled.
A disabled counter channel will not be accessed
by any of \fBspec\fP\(aqs commands.
Any \fBcdef()\fP\-defined macros will automatically exclude
the portions of the macro keyed to the particular counter
when the counter is software disabled.

\fBgetcounts\fP
\- 
Loads the built\-in array \fBS[]\fP with the scaler counts.

.HP 5m
."
\fBS[]\fP
\- 
Built\-in array that holds scaler contents after a \fBgetcounts\fP command.
.HP 5m
."
\fBCOUNT\fP
\- 
Global variable that holds the default count time
used by the \fBct\fP, \fBuct\fP and \fBuctn\fP macros.
.HP 5m
."
\fBCOUNT_TIME\fP
\- 
Global variable that holds the actual count time
used by the \fBct\fP, \fBuct\fP and \fBuctn\fP macros.
.HP 5m
."
\fBDET\fP
\- 
Global variable that is set to the channel
to be used as the detector during scans, usually set to \fBdet\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBMON\fP
\- 
Global variable that is set to channel
to be treated as the monitor during scans, usually set to \fBmon\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBMON_RATE\fP
\- 
Global variable that holds the value \fBS[MON]/S[sec]\fP
and is updated in the count macro.
.RE
.sp
Scaler channel assignments and scaler mnemonics are set in the \fBconfig\fP file.
The standard assignments for the first three channels are:
.sp
.RS 4m
.nf
\fBsec\fP = channel 0
\fBmon\fP = channel 1
\fBdet\fP = channel 2

\fBcounters [new_mon new_det]\fP
\- 
With scaler channel arguments, this macro assigns
those channels to the \fBMON\fP and \fBDET\fP symbols
and displays the changed scaler assignment.
Without arguments, the macro displays the current counter assignments,
then prompts for new counter channels for \fBMON\fP and \fBDET\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBct\fP
\- 
A macro that counts for \fBCOUNT\fP time if invoked without arguments,
or for the time given as an argument.
After counting, the macro prints the scaler contents.
If interrupted with a \fB^C\fP,
the counts at the time of the interrupt are displayed.
.HP 5m
."
\fBuct\fP
\- 
As above, but updates the screen with the scaler contents while counting.
The screen is updated every \fBUPDATE\fP seconds.
Only the first six counter channels are displayed.
.HP 5m
."
\fBuctn\fP
\- 
As above, but uses cursor control commands
to update a multiple line display at the bottom of the screen
and will work with more than six counters.
.HP 5m
."
\fBshow_cnts\fP
\- 
A macro that reads counters and displays the scaler contents on the screen.
.HP 5m
."
\fBscan_count\fP
\- 
Normally defined as \fB_count\fP, it is called by all the scan macros.
It is redefined in powder mode to be \fB_pcount\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fB_count\fP
\- 
Normally defined as \fBcount\fP, redefined by the \fBsetscans\fP macro
when updated counting during scans is in effect.
.HP 5m
."
\fBcount\fP
\- 
Default routine for counting during scans.
It waits for moving to end, counts, waits and reads scalers.
It also uses the \fBchk_beam\fP macro.
.HP 5m
."
\fBchk_beam\fP
\- 
A \fBhook\fP macro, normally defined as \fBbreak\fP.
Can be used to wait for sufficient counts during scans.
See the macro source file \fBcount.mac\fP for details.
.HP 5m
."
\fBuser_getcounts\fP
\- 
A \fBhook\fP macro that allows the user to insert code, if necessary,
after the call to \fBgetcounts\fP either to postprocess the counter values,
or to implement user\-level counters.
For example, in a configuration where the distance between
the detector and the sample varies with the cosine of an angle,
\fBuser_getcounts\fP is defined
to multiply \fBS[DET]\fP by an appropriate factor.
.HP 5m
."
\fBuser_precount\fP
\- 
A \fBhook\fP macro that allows the user to insert code
to be run before the call to \fBtcount()\fP or \fBmcount()\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBuser_postcount\fP
\- 
A \fBhook\fP macro that allows the user to insert code
to be run after the call to \fBtcount()\fP or \fBmcount()\fP.
.RE
.sp
A negative argument to \fBct\fP, \fBuct\fP, \fBuctn\fP or \fBcount\fP
means count to monitor counts.
