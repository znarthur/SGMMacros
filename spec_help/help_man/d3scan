.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
\fBd3scan\fP scans three motors, as specified by \fBmotor1\fP, \fBmotor2\fP and
\fBmotor3\fP. Each motor moves the same number of intervals.
If each motor is at a position
\fBX\fP before the scan begins, it will be scanned from
\fBX+start\fP to \fBX+end\fP.
The step size for each motor is \fB(start\-end)/intervals\fP.
The number of data points collected will be \fBintervals+1\fP.
Count time is given by \fBtime\fP, which if positive, specifies
seconds and if negative, specifies monitor counts.
.sp
Upon termination, the motors are returned to their starting positions.
