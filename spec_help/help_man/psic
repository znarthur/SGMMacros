.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBpsic\fP version of \fBspec\fP operates a type of six\-circle diffractometer
that has two circles to orient the detector and four circles to
orient the sample.  Unlike the traditional six\-circle configuration,
the sample circles are not coupled to the motions of the detector circles.
.sp
The angle calculations and operating modes for the
psi\-circle diffractometer are based on those
presented in a paper by
H. You of Argonne National Lab in
\fBJ. Appl. Cryst.\fP, \fB32\fP, 614\-623 (1999).
(See \fI\%http://journals.iucr.org/j/issues/1999/04/00/hn0093\fP)
.SH "CONVENTIONS"

The psi\-circle motor names and mnemonics are as follows:

l l l l .
	\fBDelta\fP	\fBdel\fP	\- Rotates detector arm
	\fBEta\fP	\fBeta\fP	\- Holds \fBchi\fP and \fBphi\fP circles

.TE
.sp
The mnemonics are compiled into the C code, so must match
those given above, while the motor names can be anything.
.sp
The \fBketa\fP, \fBkap\fP and
\fBkphi\fP motors are associated with the kappa variation of
the psi\-circle diffractometer.
In such a configuration, these motors are the real motors, while the
\fBeta\fP, \fBchi\fP and \fBphi\fP are pseudo\-motors (indicated by controller\-type
\fBNONE\fP in the configuration file).
.sp
The last motor, \fBdaz\fP, corresponds to an optional azimuthal rotation
of the detector used to maintain a specific angular acceptance.
See the section on detector rotation below.
.SH "PSI\-CIRCLE MODES"
.rs
.sp
The psi\-circle modes represent various constraints that
can be made on the extra three degrees of freedom available in
the transformation from reciprocal
space to diffractometer angles.
Use the \fBsetmode\fP macro to select a psi\-circle mode.
.sp
The psi\-circle geometry code
uses a different formalism for specifying operating modes than previous
\fBspec\fP geometries.
Instead of just one value to select a mode,
up to five small numbers select the mode.
The following table shows what the five numbers represent.

The first row indicates the names used to refer to the five mode parameters.
The first and last columns are the possible values for those parameters.
The \fBX\fP positions are not used.
Some modes allow zero for \fBg_mode1\fP and/or \fBg_mode2\fP.

In general, the first two columns are related
to detector angles and pseudo\-angles,
while the last three columns are used to set sample circles.

.SH "CUT POINTS"
.rs
.sp
Cut points affect the direction the diffractometer circles turn to get from
one position to the next.  For example,
if a cut point is at zero, the corresponding circle will only move through
angles of 0 to 360 degrees.
Thus, to get from 355 (=\-5) to 5 degrees,
the circle will turn 350 degrees.
If a cut point is at \-180, the circle will
move through angles from \-180 to 180.
Thus the same motion from \-5 to 5 will require only 10 degrees of movement.
Use the \fBcuts\fP macro to select cut points for all the diffractometer angles.
.SH "SECTORS"
.rs
.sp
The calculation of
\fBHKL\fP from the six diffractometer circles involves sums and products
of the sines and the cosines of each angle.
If one takes each angle \fBx\fP and substitutes \fB\-x\fP, 180 + \fBx\fP and 180 \- \fBx\fP
(which only affects the sign of the sines and cosines), one can find
sixteen combinations where the sign changes cancel out,
resulting in identical
\fBHKL\fP values for any set of diffractometer angles.
Some of these alternative angle settings may
be better suited to constraints of a particular experiment
or experimental configuration.
For historical reasons, \fBspec\fP refers to these alternative angle
settings as \fBsectors\fP.
.sp
If one or more of the diffractometer angles is set to a multiple of
\fBpi\fP/2, it is possible that additional combinations of angles, other than the
sixteen combinations mentioned above, become available.
As of \fBspec\fP release 5.06.04\-1, the
\fBpsic\fP geometry code does a exhaustive search through all possible
transformations in order to find any additional available sectors.
In addition, besides ruling out the transformations
that violate the frozen\-angle constraints
or wind up at a different
\fBHKL\fP, the new code also rules out angle combinations that
are outside the software motor limits.
.sp
\fBspec\fP provides two methods of choosing sectors.
One can have one of the 16 legacy transformations always performed
(although the resulting angles may well violate the fixed
conditions associated with the current geometry mode).
Or one can have \fBspec\fP run through all the transformations,
and after rejecting those that violate the frozen conditions or motor limits,
select the one that best conforms to a built\-in ranking scheme.
.sp
The sixteen transformations that always result in identical
\fBHKL\fP are as follows:

Note, for sector transformations on the detector circles when
used with the \fBnaz\fP\- and \fBqaz\fP\-fixed modes and the
constraints \fBeta\fP=\fBdel\fP/2 or \fBmu\fP=\fBnu\fP/2
the \fBeta\fP or \fBmu\fP angles will be modified to maintain the constraint
and the remaining sample circles will be recalculated
to keep the same reciprocal
space coordinates (as of \fBspec\fP release 5.05.04\-01).
.sp
To have one of the above transformations always performed,
use the \fBsector\fP macro (or assign a value to the
\fBg_sect\fP symbol).
Set the sector to zero to have \fBspec\fP
use the ranking method and examine a greater number of possible sector
transformations.
.sp
So far, three ranking schemes are implemented.
The first is for a pseudo\-vertical orientation, the second
for a pseudo\-horizontal orientation and the third to accommodates
users at ESRF\(aqs ID01 beamline.
Each scheme favors keeping particular circles within angular ranges
as follows:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
1 Pseudo\-vert:  0 <= del    chi < 180   \-90 <=  nu mu eta < 90
2 Pseudo\-horz:  0 <=     nu chi < 180   \-90 <= del mu eta < 90
3 ESRF ID1:     0 <= del nu chi < 180   \-90 <=     mu eta < 90
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
For the kappa configuration, \fBchi\fP is kept between two times the kappa angle
(\fBg_kappa\fP) and that angle minus 180 degrees.
.sp
For ranking sector transformations, \fBspec\fP currently uses a somewhat
\fBad hoc\fP weighting scheme.
Weights for the \fBdel\fP, \fBnu\fP, \fBmu\fP, \fBeta\fP and
\fBchi\fP transformations are assigned values of 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1,
respectively, if the angle falls in the preferred range.
The transformation with the highest ranking
(that doesn\(aqt violate the constraints of the geometry mode)
is then selected.
.sp
The ranking scheme is selected by assigning values to
\fBg_prefer\fP. A value of one
selects the vertical orientation ranking scheme, a value of
two selects the horizontal ranking scheme and a value of three selects
the ESRF ID1 scheme.
.sp
Users are encouraged to suggest additional ranking schemes that meet
particular needs, and CSS will endeavor to include them in future
releases.
.sp
If both \fBg_sect\fP and
\fBg_prefer\fP are zero, then the sector 1 angles (no transformations) are used.
.sp
See the \fBsectors\fP and the \fBShowSect\fP macros below
for options on displaying the possible transformations.

.SH "ZEROS AND ROTATION SENSE"
.rs
.sp
In order for the calculations in the \fBpsi\fP\-circle code to work correctly,
you must set the rotation sense and zeros
of the circles according to the conventions built into the code.
.sp
The laboratory coordinate system used in the code is right handed.
The \fBx\fP axis points upward and the
\fBy\fP axis points along the direction of the incident beam.
When all circle are at zero, the
\fBz\fP axis points outward from a sample mounted on the \fBphi\fP circle.
.sp
The rotation sense is defined with respect to the positive unit vectors of the
coordinate system described above.
For a right\-handed rotation, if your thumb points along the unit vector that
is in line with the rotation axis,
your fingers will point in the positive rotation direction.
.sp
The rotation sense of an axis can be changed by changing the sign of the
\fBsteps\-per\-degree\fP parameter or the \fBsign\-of\-user*dial\fP parameter in the
\fBconfig\fP file.
You should set the sign of the first parameter so that the \fBspec\fP
dial positions agree with the dial indicators of each circle.
Set the sign of the second parameter as necessary to make the
\fBspec\fP user angles agree with
the rotation sense described below.
.sp
The \fBmu\fP and \fBnu\fP circles are in the
\fBy\fP\-\fBz\fP plane, with the rotation axes along the
\fBx\fP axis with a right\-handed rotation convention.
The zero of \fBmu\fP is such that the \fBeta\fP circle
is on the negative side of the
\fBx\fP\-\fBy\fP plane with its rotation axis along the \fBz\fP axis.
Likewise, the zero of \fBnu\fP is such that the
\fBdelta\fP circle is also on the negative side of the
\fBx\fP\-\fBy\fP plane with the rotation axis also along the \fBz\fP axis.
.sp
The
\fBdelta\fP, \fBeta\fP and \fBphi\fP circles all have a left\-handed rotation sense.
The \fBdelta\fP circle is at zero when the detector arm is along the positive
\fBy\fP direction.
\fBEta\fP is zero when the \fBchi\fP circle is in the
\fBx\fP\-\fBz\fP plane, with the \fBchi\fP axis along the \fBy\fP axis.
The \fBchi\fP rotation is right\-handed.
The zero of \fBchi\fP puts the \fBphi\fP rotation axis along the
\fBz\fP direction with the "surface normal" of the
\fBphi\fP table pointed in the positive \fBz\fP direction.
The zero of the \fBphi\fP circle is arbitrary.
.sp
In the \fBkappa\fP configuration, the \fBeta\fP, \fBchi\fP and
\fBphi\fP real motors are replaced with \fBketa\fP, \fBkap\fP and
\fBkphi\fP. The \fBketa\fP and
\fBkphi\fP circles have the same left\-handed rotation convention as
\fBeta\fP and \fBphi\fP, while \fBkap\fP is right handed.
The zero of \fBketa\fP is chosen so that the rotation axis of the
\fBkap\fP motor lies in the positive \fBy\fP\-\fBz\fP quadrant.
The zero of \fBkap\fP places the \fBphi\fP rotation axis in the positive
\fBz\fP direction.  The zero of \fBkphi\fP is arbitrary.
.SH "AZIMUTHAL DETECTOR ROTATION"
.rs
.sp
The optional motor \fBdaz\fP (for detector azimuth)
corresponds to an azimuthal rotation of the detector or detector slits
that can be
used to maintain a specific angular acceptance at the detector.
The theory for this motion is described  by
E. Vlieg in \fBJ. Appl. Cryst.\fP, \fB31\fP, 198\-203 (1998).
(See \fI\%http://journals.iucr.org/j/issues/1998/02/00/pe0028\fP)
.sp
The macros \fBon_daz\fP and
\fBoff_daz\fP are available to enable and disable the rotation.
The automatic rotation only occurs when moving to reciprocal space
positions.
That is, the target position is calculated along with the other
geometry motor positions by \fBcalcA\fP.
