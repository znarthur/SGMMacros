.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.sp
The NT\-2400 from Laboratory Equipment Corporation is an
ethernet\-based instrument providing motor control, timer/counter functions
and MCA capability.
.sp
Note, as there is a 20\-character limit to the device names
entered using \fBspec\fP\(aqs hardware configuration editor,
it will be helpful to have a short name in the
\fB/etc/hosts\fP file to identify the NT\-2400 host, such as
.sp
.RS 4m
\fB192.42.172.13   nt2400.localnet.edu nt2400\fP
.RE
.sp
To configure \fBspec\fP for the NT\-2400 hardware, either run the
\fBconfig\fP macro from \fBspec\fP or the configuration editor
\fBedconf\fP directly.  Change to the \fBD\fPevices
screen to configure the hostname and port number
of the motor controllers and counter/timers.
The selections will look something like the following, with the
\fBNUM\fP
field specifying the total number of motors/counters at the specified host.
(Note, type the single quote \fB\(aq\fP to begin string\-entry mode to enter the
DEVICE name.
Use the \fB<\fP and \fB>\fP characters to select from the TYPE menu.)

For the scaler configuration, the first example is for when one of
the scaler channels is to be used as master timer.
With the second example, all the scalers are used only as counters.
.sp
The MCA devices are configured on the \fBA\fPcquisition\-type
device screen of the configuration editor.
For two MCA modules on the same NT\-2400 host,
the screen would look something like:

Unit numbers are assigned in the order in which the NT\-2400 motor
controller units are specified on the Devices screen, and start at zero.
Channel numbers start at one to match the NT\-2400 numbering convention.
It is not necessary for the motors to be consecutively ordered in
the configuration.
.sp
The \fBpulse\-mode\fP parameter (100 or 200)
can optionally be entered on the second optional motor parameter screen
(accessed by typing \fBm\fP twice from the main motor screen).
Enter values for the pulse mode in the field for Generic parameter 1.
If no value is entered, the default value of 100 is used.
In addition, the limit and home switch polarity can be optionally
configured by entering a value for Generic parameter 2.
The coding for switch polarities is as follows:
.sp
.RS 4m
.nf
Bit 0 set: ccw limit positive
Bit 1 set: home switch positive
Bit 2 set: cw limit positive

For the NT\-2400, only channel 2 can be used as the time base channel
and only channel 1 can be used for the monitor preset counter.
If there is no monitor\-type preset counter, and there are only two
counter channels, then channel 1 should be configured as the ordinary
counter detector channel.
.sp
With such a configuration, all the standard commands for moving motors,
counting and accessing the MCA are available.
.sp
Note, setting \fBspec\fP\(aqs debug level to 128 (using the
\fBdebug\fP macro or by assigning a value to the
\fBDEBUG\fP built\-in variable) will have \fBspec\fP display the commands sent and
data returned from the NT\-2400 in a semi\-readable form.
