.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
These notes summarize the modifications made for \fBspec\fP release 2.12,
as finalized on May 23, 1989.
.SH "CHANGES"
.rs
.sp
A new scan\-plotting option has been added at the macro level.
You can choose to have a continuously updated plot made on the video screen
as the points of the scan are collected.
Use the
\fBsetplot\fP
macro to select this mode.
.sp
The history\-substitution
mechanism has been expanded a bit.
You may now append text to recalled items.
.sp
History is now retained when you exit the program and restored when
you restart.
The
\fBsavstate\fP
command will include command history in the state file, and the
\fBgetstate\fP
command will restore the command history from the last issued
\fBsavstate\fP.
.sp
A new powder\-averaging mode for scans is available.
When
powder
mode is on, the selected powder\-average motor
is run
at its base rate
a selected width about each point in each
scan.
The scalers are automatically enabled for counting during the time
the motor is in motion.
Powder mode works with all the angle scans and HKL scans.
Use the macro
\fBsetpowder\fP
to turn powder mode on and off.
See the
\fBpowder\fP
help file for details.
.sp
The command
\fBmove_cnt\fP
has been added to make
powder
mode
work.
This command works similarly to
\fBmove_all\fP
except the motors
are moved at the base rate, no backlash is performed and
the scalers are automatically gated while the motors move.
.sp
All the scan macros required slight modifications
to make
powder
mode work.
New global variables,
\fB_stype0\fP
and
\fB_stype1\fP
are assigned
values to indicate the type of scan in progress.
In addition,
some of the statements in each scan loop have been gathered
into a new macro named
\fBscan_move\fP.
The
\fBscan_move\fP
macro is assigned a
different definition in
powder
mode.
Also, the
\fBcount\fP
macro called by all the scans has been
made redefinable to accommodate
powder
mode.
Study the macro files
\fBscans.mac\fP,
\fBcount.mac\fP
and
\fBpowder.mac\fP
to see just how
these things are done.
.sp
A new four\-circle geometry mode has been added called
\fBphi fixed\fP.
This mode
is similar to the existing three\-circle (phi\-zero) mode,
except the value of
\fBphi\fP
no longer needs to be fixed at zero.
.sp
A new geometry configuration, named
\fBr2d2\fP
after the high\-vacuum surface chamber that it describes,
is included in the distribution.
The geometry code is in the file
\fBgeo_r2d2.c\fP.
.sp
\fBspec\fP has
two distinct phases during the process of interpreting user commands:
the parse phase and the execution phase.
Previously,
a macro definition assigned with
\fBdef\fP
would be carried out in the execution phase,
making the definition unavailable until the entire
enclosing statement block had been read in and parsed.
This method of handling macro definitions
made it impossible to enclose any of the
recently (release 2.10) redesigned standard
scan macros within a statement block, since the same macro
was both defined and invoked with the scan macro.
To solve this problem,
macro\-definition assignments are now made as they are encountered during
the parse phase.
However, since several \fBspec\fP macros still require
macro definitions to be made during the execution (or run) phase,
a new command called
\fBrdef\fP
has been introduced.
This new command behaves now like
\fBdef\fP
used to.
See the macros
\fBsetplot\fP,
\fBsetpowder\fP,
\fBlup\fP
or
\fB_head\fP
for examples
of the use of
\fBrdef\fP.
.sp
The maximum macro length has been increased a bit
from 1536 to 1920 bytes.
.sp
Clock\-tick
sleeps are now available with \fBspec\fP on non\-VENIX systems.
Clock\-tick sleeps are sleeps with sixtieth of a second resolution.
New versions of
either of the drivers
\fBdsp.c\fP
or
\fBoms.c\fP
must be installed, though,
and the clock\-tick sleeps will only work when the corresponding device
has been opened.
Clock\-tick sleeps work well with the sleep\-time variable
\fBUPDATE\fP
used in updated\-move
macros such as
\fBumv\fP,
\fBumk\fP
and
\fBuwm\fP.
.sp
\fBspec\fP is now supported on the AT&T 6386 platform running UNIX version 3.2.
.sp
The National Instruments GPIB boards are now supported for
VENIX 286 and for the various 386 systems.
Drivers for the 386 systems must be obtained directly from
National Instruments.
.sp
The Scientific Solutions (Tecmar) GPIB support code has been
rewritten following the sample programs provided by the manufacturer.
In addition, this board can now be used on the 386 systems.
On the 386 systems a supplied program called
\fBio_enable\fP
is automatically run the first time the board is used in order
to enable the IO ports used by the board to be accessible from
user\-level programs.
.sp
The code to support the Kinetic Systems CAMAC GPIB board (KS3388)
has been fixed.
A timing problem in the code that rarely, if ever, manifested itself
on the PDP and
80286 systems had made the module unusable on the 386 systems.
.sp
The driver files, formerly
distributed in the subdirectories
\fBcamac\fP
and
\fBoms\fP
are
now distributed in the subdirectory
\fBdrivers\fP.
Three master installation scripts,
\fBinstall_vnx\fP,
\fBinstall_386\fP,
and
\fBinstall_att\fP,
are supplied that
are invoked by driver\-specific scripts, such as
\fBinstall_dsp\fP
for the DSP CAMAC driver,
\fBinstall_oms\fP
for
the Oregon Micro Systems PCX driver and
\fBinstall_gpib\fP
for
the National Instruments PCII GPIB driver.
.sp
A problem on the 386 systems, where using
a number larger than
the largest long integer in a print statement or expression
would cause a floating exception and possibly a core dump,
has been fixed.
