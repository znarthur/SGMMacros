.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The Matrox Meteor frame grabber is a PCI board supported by \fBspec\fP on
\fBLinux\fP platforms through the kernel\-level driver available at
\fI\%ftp://ftp.rwii.com/pub/linux/system/Meteor/\fP.
(The currently supported driver version is 1.5.4.)
.sp
\fBspec\fP treats the frame grabber as a CCD\-like device.
It is selected on the \fBA\fPcquisition\-type
device screen of the configuration editor as:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB

The device name, of course, must match what was created with the driver
installation.  The address field (ADDR) is used
to select the signal format for the frame grabber as follows:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
ADDR Format Size
 1   NTSC   480x640
 2   PAL    576x768
 3   SECAM  576x768

Currently \fBspec\fP sets the input source to the RCA\-type connector
when the device is opened.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.rs
.sp
From \fBspec\fP, the frame grabber is accessed as an image device.
It is read using the \fBimage_get()\fP function, for example, as
.sp
.RS 4m
.nf
\fBubyte array image[480][640]\fP
\fBimage_get(0, image)\fP
.fi
.sp
.RE
.sp
The native data type the unsigned byte
\fBubyte\fP, as used above.
.sp
Special options include:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "single")\fP
\- 
Selects single\-capture mode.
Every \fBimage_get()\fP function will start a single frame capture,
and wait until the frame
is available.  The frame buffer will then be copied to the user\(aqs data area.
Single\-capture mode is the default on start\-up.
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "continuous")\fP
\- 
Selects continuous\-capture mode.
Each time \fBimage_get()\fP is called,
\fBspec\fP will check the time stamp on the current frame buffer.
When the time stamp changes from \fBspec\fP\(aqs previously saved value,
\fBspec\fP will copy the
current frame buffer contents to the user\(aqs data area.
This method should insure that a different frame is returned each time.
(A more robust method of collecting a series of frames
may be implemented in the future.  Contact CSS for more information.)
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "fps" [, value])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets the number of frames per second acquired
by the device in continuous\-capture mode.
The maximum value is 30 in NTSC mode and 25 in PAL and SECAM modes.
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "timestamp")\fP
\- 
Returns the time stamp of the last frame obtained via \fBimage_get()\fP
in terms of the current UNIX epoch.
(The UNIX epoch is the number of seconds
from January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.)
The value returned includes a fractional part with the resolution
of the system clock.
The value returned is in the same units as \fBspec\fP\(aqs \fBtime()\fP function.
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "frames")\fP
\- 
Returns the current frame count.
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "showall")\fP
\- 
Displays internal driver information.
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "reset")\fP
\- 
Resets the hardware interface.
