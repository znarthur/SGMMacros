.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.rs
.sp
\fBwait(mode)\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The function \fBwait()\fP is used to synchronize
the flow of commands in \fBspec\fP with
moving, counting and other activity.  Since
the built\-in commands and functions \fBmove_all\fP,
\fBmove_cnt\fP, \fBtcount()\fP and
\fBmcount()\fP return immediately after starting moving or counting,
macros need to include some form of
\fBwait()\fP if the next command requires the previous move or count
to complete.
.sp
The argument \fBmode\fP specifies what is to be waited for:
.sp
.RS 4m

;
l l .
0	\- moving, counting and other acquisition
1	\- (bit 0) moving
2	\- (bit 1) counting (by the master timer)
4	\- (bit 2) other acquisition (MCAs, CCDs, etc.)
8	\- (bit 3) remote connections and remote asynchronous events
32	\- (bit 5) return zero or nonzero to indicate if busy

.sp
If \fBmode\fP is a negative number,
\fBwait()\fP will behave as for \fBmode\fP = 0,
but a message will be printed showing what is being waited on.
.sp
For acquisition devices with \fB"auto_run"\fP mode enabled (such devices
are started automatically during counting), waiting for counting
will also include waiting for those devices (as of \fBspec\fP release 5.09.01\-1).
.sp
When \fBspec\fP is running as client to a \fBspec\fP server, bit 3
checks if \fBremote_async()\fP replies have all arrived.
In addition, bit 3 also checks if all configured \fBspec\fP servers have connected
and if all \fBspec\fP server and EPICS remote motors have connected.
.sp
Waiting for \fBspec\fP server and remote motor  connections is mainly an issue
on start up or after \fBreconfig\fP. One might use \fBwait(8)\fP or
\fBwait(0x28)\fP in the built\-in special macro
\fBconfig_mac\fP if it is important to delay until all connections are up.
Note, until remote \fBspec\fP server and EPICS motors
are fully connected and usable, the positions reported for those motors
will be the last saved positions from \fBspec\fP\(aqs \fBsettings\fP file.
.sp
Also, note that \fBwait(0)\fP does not check
for the remote events flagged by bit 3.
To wait for remote events requires explicitly setting bit 3 in
\fBmode\fP. Also, a \fB^C\fP interrupts a \fBwait(8)\fP but doesn\(aqt
change the conditions that caused \fBwait(8)\fP to block.
That is, the next \fBwait(8)\fP will still block
if there are still pending connections.
.sp
If bit 5 (0x20) in \fBmode\fP is set, \fBwait()\fP returns true (1)
if the activities flagged by bits 0, 1, 2 or 3 are still going on,
otherwise \fBwait()\fP returns false (0).
