.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBspec_par()\fP function allows access to certain
internal parameters of \fBspec\fP as described below.
Most parameters can be set using the \fB\-o\fP start\-up option
(see the \fI\%spec\fP help file).
Some parameters can only be set using the start\-up option.
As of \fBspec\fP release 5.03.01, some hardware\-related parameters
can also be set in the \fBconfig\fP file, using the following syntax:
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBSPEC_PAR: epics_timeout = 2\fP
.RE
.sp
The declarations have to be entered manually, but will be maintained
by the \fBedconf\fP configuration editor.
The declaration can be located anywhere in the file.
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBspec_par("?")\fP
\- 
Displays all the parameters and their values.
If the current value differs from the default value,
the default value is displayed in parenthesis (as of release 5.08.02\-8).
.HP 5m
."
\fBspec_par("set_defaults")\fP
\- 
Sets all parameters to their default values.
.HP 5m
."
\fBspec_par(par\fP)
\- 
Returns the current value of the parameter \fBpar\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBspec_par(par, value\fP)
\- 
Sets the internal parameter \fBpar\fP to \fBvalue\fP.
.RE
.sp
The \fBspec_par()\fP parameters are:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fB"anka_remote_host"\fP, \fB"anka_remote_node"\fP, \fB"anka_locate_node"\fP
\- 
This parameters are only visible when
the ANKA RST Gamma hardware is configured.
See the \fI\%anka\fP help file for an explanation of what they mean.
These parameters can be set in the \fBconfig\fP file.
.RE
.HP 5m
."
\fB"auto_file_close"\fP
\- 
The auto\-file\-close option is available to automatically close output files
that haven\(aqt been accessed for some interval of time.
The parameter units are hours,
and the parameter can have nonintegral values.
When the auto\-close option is enabled, each time an
\fBon()\fP, \fBoff()\fP, \fBopen()\fP, \fBclose()\fP
or \fBfprintf()\fP function is called,
\fBspec\fP will check its list of opened output files.
Any files which have not been written to for the length of time given by
\fBvalue\fP hours will be closed.
Enabling this option can help prevent errors when your macros or commands
do not close files when appropriate, resulting
in \fBspec\fP running out of resources to open additional files.
.sp
As files are opened automatically when sent output,
auto\-close mode operates transparently for the most part.
However, if you change to a different working
directory between the time the file is first
opened and subsequently automatically closed,
and if the file is not opened by an
absolute path name, the next time you refer to the file,
\fBspec\fP will reopen it using a relative path based
on the current directory.
.sp
If \fBvalue\fP is zero, the mode is disabled.
By default, the mode is initially disabled.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"auto_hdw_poll"\fP
\- 
When automatic hardware polling is turned on,
\fBspec\fP will automatically poll busy motor controllers, timers and
acquisition devices to determine when they are finished.
For some polled devices, \fBspec\fP needs to perform an action, such as
starting a motor backlash move,
when the device is finished with its current business.
Without automatic hardware polling, a call to the
\fBwait()\fP function is necessary.
The default is for this mode to be on.
A reason to turn it off may be to reduce the amount of debugging output
during hardware debugging.
Early versions of \fBspec\fP made more frequent use of
interrupt\-driven devices (certain motor controllers and timers),
for which this mode is irrelevant.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"check_file_names"\fP
\- 
The check\-file\-names option can prevent you from (accidentally)
creating files
with names containing nonstandard characters.
When enabled, if a file name passed to the
\fBon()\fP, \fBopen()\fP or \fBfprintf()\fP functions contains
any of the characters
\fB()[]{}|$\(aq\(ga*?;!&<>\e\e@\fP, the space character, any
control characters or any characters with the eighth bit set,
and the file doesn\(aqt already exist,
\fBspec\fP will print a error messages and reset to command level.
By default, this mode is on.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"confirm_quit"\fP
\- 
If set, \fBspec\fP prompts with a "Really quit?" message when the
\fBquit\fP or \fB^D\fP commands are entered.
The question must be answered in the affirmative to exit the program.
The value for \fB"confirm_quit"\fP is not saved in the state file.
The option must be set again on each \fBspec\fP invocation.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"elog_level"\fP
\- 
The level at which commands are saved to the
\fBelog\fP error files is set using this option.
At level 1, the default, only commands typed at the keyboard are logged.
At level 2, the commands read from command files are also logged.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"elog_timestamp"\fP
\- 
The time interval for the optional time stamps for the
\fBelog\fP error file capability is set using this option.
The units of the \fB"elog_timestamp"\fP parameter are minutes.
The default value is 5 minutes.  Note, time stamps are only added
before a command or error message is logged, so that the interval
between time stamps can be greater than that specified if no commands
are being typed or errors generated.
However, for time\-stamp intervals less
than 1 second (or 0.1666 min), every command and
error message will be preceded by a time stamp, and the time stamp
will include fractional seconds in the epoch value.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"epics_timeout"\fP
\- 
Sets the default timeout for channel access
\fBca_pend_io()\fP calls on EPICS.  The default value is 0.5 seconds.
This option appears only when \fBspec\fP is linked with the
EPICS channel access libraries.
Timeout values for individual process variables can still be
changed with the \fBepics_par()\fP function.
This parameter can be set in the \fBconfig\fP file.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"fast_hdw_checks"\fP
\- 
When in server\-mode, if set, the \fBspec\fP server
will use an adaptive algorithm for
polling hardware status.
If the interval between client messages is less than one second, the server
will use a faster polling frequency for checking
for both hardware status and
the next client message, thus providing a client
with faster notifications of changes in hardware state.
This parameter can be set in the \fBconfig\fP file.
With its (documented) introduction
in \fBspec\fP release 5.08.06\-2, the mode is off by default.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"flush_interval"\fP
\- 
The flush\-interval parameter controls how often \fBspec\fP flushes output
to the hard disk or other output devices.
Traditionally, \fBspec\fP flushed output after each print command.
However, as some users report that this frequent
flushing introduces considerable delays
when the output device is to an NFS\-mounted file system,
the flushing interval can now be controlled.
The \fB"flush_interval"\fP parameter
specifies how many seconds to allow between output buffer flushing.
The default value is 0.5 seconds.
If the interval is set to zero, the traditional frequent\-flushing behavior
will be restored.
Output to the screen is still flushed immediately.
Output is also flushed each time the main \fBspec\fP prompt is issued.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"HKL_rounding"\fP
\- 
Traditionally, \fBspec\fP rounded values for \fBH\fP, \fBK\fP and
\fBL\fP (and other geometry values derived from motor positions)
to five significant digits for configurations using reciprocal space
calculations.
As of release 4.03.01, the rounding is now turned off by default.
It can be turned on using the command \fBspec_par("HKL_rounding", 1e5)\fP
where the argument indicates the magnitude of the rounding, i.e.,
one part in 1e5, for example.
Note, values with an absolute value less than 1e\-10 are still
rounded to zero whether or not the optional rounding is turned on.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"hdw_poll_interval"\fP
\- 
When the \fBwait()\fP function is called to
wait for polled motors, timers or other acquisition devices to finish,
\fBspec\fP sleeps for a small interval between each check of the hardware.
Use this \fBspec_par()\fP option to change that interval.
The units of the parameter are milliseconds, and
the default sleep time is 10msec.
A value of zero is allowed, though
not recommended if the computer is being used for anything else.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"keep_going"\fP
\- 
Normally, when taking commands from a command file, \fBspec\fP resets
to command level and the main interactive prompt when there
are syntax errors in the file, certain floating point exceptions,
references to unconfigured hardware, hardware access errors, along
with a number of other errors.
When the \fB"keep_going"\fP option is set,
\fBspec\fP will keep reading and executing commands from
a command file no matter what errors occur.
When there is an error,
the next line from the current command file will be read.
Note, depending on where the error is in a file, reading subsequent
lines may generate more errors, particularly if the error occurs
inside a statement block.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"modify_step_size"\fP
\- 
Normally, \fBspec\fP doesn\(aqt allow users to
modify the motor step\-size parameter
with the \fBmotor_par()\fP function, as the consequences
are generally undesirable.
However, in the rare circumstance that it is necessary, this
parameter allows you to enable such modifications.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"old_shared"\fP
\- 
With \fBspec\fP release 5.02.01, the structure of the shared array header was
changed so that the data portion of the array
would lie on a memory page boundary.
To allow compatibility with applications built with the old header
structure, the \fB"old_shared"\fP option can be set.
However, this option can only be set as a \fB\-o\fP
command line start\-up option, and
the parameter is not saved in the state file.
It must be set each time \fBspec\fP is invoked.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"parse_units"\fP
\- 
When parsing of units is turned on, numbers typed
as input to \fBspec\fP\(aqs parser
with one of the following suffixes appended will automatically
be multiplied by the corresponding factor.
.TS
;
l l .
\fB1r  = 57.2958\fP	\fBradian\fP
\fB1mr = 0.0572958\fP	\fBmilliradian\fP
\fB1d  = 1\fP	\fBdegree\fP
\fB1md = 0.001\fP	\fBmillidegree\fP
\fB1mm = 1\fP	\fBmillimeter\fP
\fB1um = 0.001\fP	\fBmicrometer\fP
\fB1m  = 0.0166667\fP	\fBminute\fP
\fB1s  = 0.000277778\fP	\fBsecond\fP
.TE
.sp
Note, however, suffixes on numbers converted from strings
or entered using the \fBgetval()\fP function are not parsed.
The only known use for unit\-suffix parsing is with
the user\-contributed macros in the file \fBmacros/units.mac\fP. These macros
require that unit suffixes be supplied
for all motor position arguments in the standard \fBspec\fP macros.
The default is for this mode to be off.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"show_prdef_files"\fP
\- 
When this mode is on, the source file for each macro definition is
displayed with the \fBprdef\fP command.
The default is for this mode to be on.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"specwiz"\fP
\- 
Allows \fBspec\fP administrators to gain access to motors
locked out in the \fBconfig\fP file to ordinary users.
This feature allows the administrator to position the motors
without having first to go into the configuration
editor to change access modes.
Entering \fBspec_par("specwiz", 1)\fP causes \fBspec\fP to prompt for the
"Wizard\(aqs password". If entered correctly, the characters
\fB_WIZ\fP are appended to the \fBspec\fP
prompt to remind the administrator of the special powers,
and motors configured with protected status can be moved.
Entering \fBspec_par("specwiz", 0)\fP disables the special mode.
.sp
\fBspec\fP looks for the encrypted password belonging to the
spec_wiz (or specwiz) user in the files
\fBSPECD\fP\fB/passwd\fP, \fB/etc/shadow\fP, and \fB/etc/passwd\fP in turn.
If a shadow password file is used, ordinary users won\(aqt be able to
read it, and the normal password file won\(aqt contain the encrypted password.
The \fBspec\fP distribution includes
a \fBwiz_passwd\fP utility (as of release 4.03.07)
the can be used to create a
\fBpasswd\fP file in the \fBspec\fP auxiliary file directory
that contains just the entry for the spec_wiz user.
The \fBSPECD\fP\fB/passwd\fP file should probably be
owned and writable only by root or the \fBspec\fP administrator.
.sp
Note, the standard macros \fBonwiz\fP and
\fBoffwiz\fP are convenient wrappers for the spec_wiz feature.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"use_sem_undo"\fP
\- 
This flag relates to whether the
\fBSEM_UNDO\fP flag is set when semaphores are used.
It exists to get around a memory leak bug observed with
some releases of the Solaris 2 operating system.
The flag should be ignored unless you are instructed otherwise by CSS.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"warn_not_at_pos"\fP
\- 
When enabled, \fBspec\fP prints a warning message whenever a motor
doesn\(aqt reach its final position (as of release 5.08.02\-8).
