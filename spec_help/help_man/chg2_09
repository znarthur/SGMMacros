.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
These notes summarize the modifications made for \fBspec\fP release 2.9,
as finalized on October 10, 1988.
.SH "CHANGES"
.rs
.sp
Invoking \fBspec\fP with
\fB\-y\fP
will force
the motor registers to be changed to agree with the settings file
when the program starts up.
If you are confident the settings file is okay, and know the
motor registers have been wiped out, say by shutting off
crate power, then this option ought to be just the thing.
.sp
The message noting the discrepancy between motor\-controller registers
and program memory now shows the values of each in user units (angles)
in addition to steps.
.sp
Hitting a hard motor limit will cause the program to reset to
command level, whether in a scan or in a command file.
Previously, although motor motion was aborted on a hard limit,
command execution continued.
.sp
The
\fBprdef\fP
command now shows backslashes associated with
escaped delimiter characters within a macro definition,
as in:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
def silly \(aqprint "Who\e\(aqs on first?"\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
Previously, these backslashes were not shown.
.sp
All instances of the command
\fBmove_all\fP
in the standard macros
have been replaced by the macro
\fBmove_em\fP.
The default definition of
\fBmove_em\fP
is simply
\fBmove_all\fP.
The purpose of
\fBmove_em\fP
is to make it easy for the user
to
include limit checks of moves
that involve more than one motor by redefining
\fBmove_em\fP.
.sp
A new macro
\fBmesh\fP
that performs a mesh scan of any two motors
is included.
.sp
The
\fBwm\fP
and
\fBuwm\fP
macros now check that their arguments are valid
motor names.
.sp
A new built\-in command
\fBlocal\fP
(with the same syntax as the
\fBglobal\fP
command) can be used to reuse a preexisting variable name
and give the new instance of that name scope only within
and below the curly\-bracketed block in which it is defined.
A known bug with the current implementation is that you cannot use
the
\fBglobal\fP
keyword at the same level or lower to
\fBunlocalize\fP
use
of a previously local\-declared variable name.
.sp
The motor screen for the
\fBedconf\fP
configuration and settings editor now
wraps around when changing motor columns instead of sticking at motor 0
or at the last motor.
.sp
The CAMAC drivers can be optionally compiled either to allow only the
super user to issue a
\fBZ\fP
or to allow any user to issue a
\fBZ\fP.
Previously, it was only super\-user only.
.sp
This release supports the 386/ix operating system on 80386\-based
machines.
See the
\fB386\fP
help file.
