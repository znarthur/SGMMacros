\fBplot_cntl(s)\fP
\- 
Selects built\-in plotting features.  The argument
\fBs\fP is a string of comma\- or space\-delimited options.
The following options may be
preceded by a minus sign to turn the associated feature
off or  nothing (or an optional plus
sign) to turn the feature on.
A question mark before or after the option will return a value of
one or a zero
that indicates whether the associated feature is currently on or off.
For example,
.RS 5m
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
plot_cntl("xlog,ylog")    # turns x and y log\-axis mode on
plot_cntl("+xlog")        # turns x log\-axis mode on
plot_cntl("\-xlog")        # turns x log\-axis mode off
print plot_cntl("xlog?")  # returns 1 if mode on, else 0

\fB"xlog"\fP
\- 
use a logarithmic \fBx\fP axis.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"ylog"\fP
\- 
use a logarithmic \fBy\fP axis.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"xexact"\fP
\- 
force \fBx\fP\-axis minimum and maximum to be set to the scan endpoints
(as opposed to being rounded).
.HP 5m
."
\fB"colors"\fP
\- 
enable the use of colors.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"dots"\fP
\- 
draw graphics\-mode points with large dots.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"lines"\fP
\- 
connect graphics\-mode points with lines.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"ebars"\fP
\- 
draw vertical lines through each point of length equal to the twice the
square root of the \fBy\fP value.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"persist"\fP
\- 
keep graphics\-mode on after ordinary user input.  \fBspec\fP errors, a
\fB^C\fP from the keyboard or \fBplot_cntl("close")\fP restore text mode.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"perpetual"\fP
\- 
keep graphics\-mode on continuously (appropriate if using X windows, for
example).
.HP 5m
."
\fB"ascii"\fP
\- 
draw plots on the terminal window using cursor positioning commands and
ASCII characters rather than using the high\-resolution \fBx11\fP window.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"dumbterm"\fP
\- 
indicates a terminal window that lacks cursor positioning.  The
value is set automatically when \fBspec\fP starts up.  When this mode
is on, text plots are drawn down the page using only space characters
to position the plotted points.  Note when this mode is on, the
special control strings used by the \fBtty_cntl()\fP and the positioning
used by \fBtty_move()\fP are unavailable.

Other options are:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fB"font=string"\fP
\- 
sets the font used for the \fBx11\fP high\-resolution plot windows.
If the font is a scalable font, its size will be chosen to match the
current size of the plot window.
Otherwise, the font size will be fixed to either the value specified
in the font name using the
\fBX Logical Font Description Conventions\fP XLFD,
or if the size fields are wild carded, the font size will
be selected by the X server.
.RE
.HP 5m
."
\fB"title=string"\fP
\- 
sets the title\-bar text for \fBx11\fP high\-resolution plot windows.
In a comma\-separated list of arguments to \fBplot_cntl()\fP,
this one must appear last.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"geometry=string"\fP
\- 
sets the size and position for \fBx11\fP high\-resolution plot windows.
The format of the geometry string is the same as expected by
standard X windows applications, as in
.RS 5m
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
plot_cntl("geometry=512x380\-0+10")
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
As with the conventional syntax, not all parts of the geometry string
are required.
.RE
.HP 5m
."
\fB"colors=bgnd:win:text:axis:symb:..."\fP
\- 
assign colors for drawing the various graphics\-mode elements.
The values for
\fBbgnd\fP (the background color of the area outside the axis),
\fBwin\fP (the background color of the area inside the axis),
\fBtext\fP (the color of the text),
\fBaxis\fP (the color of the axis) and
\fBsymb ...\fP (the color of the plotting symbols)
are integers.
The first 10 colors are standardized according to the following table:
.sp
.RS 5m
.RS 4m
.nf
0 \- background (normally white or black)
1 \- foreground (normally black or white)
2 \- blue
3 \- red
4 \- green
5 \- yellow
6 \- cyan
7 \- magenta
8 \- white
9 \- black
.fi
.sp
.RE
.sp
Other colors may be available depending on the particular device.
You don\(aqt have to assign values to all colors.
.RE
.HP 5m
."
\fB"colors[numb]"\fP
\- 
Returns the current color assignments, where
\fBnumb\fP is a number between zero and 67.
Numbers zero through three return the colors assigned to the
\fBbgnd\fP, \fBwin\fP, \fBtext\fP and \fBaxis\fP
elements respectively.  Numbers from 4 through 67 return the colors
assigned to the plotting symbols.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"filter1"\fP
\- 
select filter 1 (the default).  All plotting commands
are directed to this filter.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"filter2"\fP, \fB"filter3"\fP, \fB"filter4"\fP, \fB"filter5"\fP
\- 
select filters 2 through 5.
Subsequent plotting commands are directed to the selected filter.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"open"\fP
\- 
turn on graphics mode.  If there is no graphics filter program
currently active for the current filter number (see above), the filter
program associated with the current \fBGTERM\fP variable is started.
The only currently useful value for \fBGTERM\fP is \fBx11\fP.
When using X11 graphics, you can assign a value to the built\-in
variable \fBDISPLAY\fP before a call of
\fBplot_cntl("open")\fP to set the X display on which the plot will be drawn.
If the filter is currently open, and you wish to change the display, use
\fBplot_cntl("kill")\fP first.  For example,
.RS 5m
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
DISPLAY="host1:0"; plot_cntl("filter1,open")
DISPLAY="host2:0"; plot_cntl("filter2,open")
.ft P

.RE
.HP 5m
."
\fB"close"\fP
\- 
turn off graphics mode, unless the perpetual
or persistent mode has been selected.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"kill"\fP
\- 
turn off graphics mode and terminate graphics process.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"erase"\fP
\- 
clear the graphics\-mode screen (or the text screen
if graphics mode is off).
.HP 5m
."
\fB"raise"\fP
\- 
raises the \fBx11\fP high\-resolution plot window to the top of the desktop
window stack, making it visible.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"addpoint"\fP
\- 
before a call to \fBarray_plot()\fP or \fBdata_plot()\fP will cause
the plot to be made with minimal redrawing.
Used for updated plotting during scans.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"addline"\fP
\- 
before a call to \fBarray_plot()\fP or
\fBdata_plot()\fP will prevent the current data from being erased
and the new data from
changing the ranges when the new data points are drawn.
Used for plotting several data sets from different data groups
or array elements on top of each other.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"mca"\fP
\- 
before a call to \fBarray_plot()\fP or
\fBdata_plot()\fP will cause the data points to be displayed using a minimal
redrawing algorithm, appropriate for displaying data actively being
accumulated by an MCA\-type device.
The \fB"dots"\fP and \fB"ebars"\fP modes must be turned off.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"lp"\fP
\- 
before a call to \fBarray_plot()\fP or
\fBdata_plot()\fP will generate printing instructions appropriate
for plotting on a 132\-column printer.
