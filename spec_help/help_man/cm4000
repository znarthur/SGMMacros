.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The Compumotor Model 4000 can be used either over its GPIB
or one of its two RS\-232C interfaces.
From the configuration editor, switch to the
\fBD\fPevice screen to select the appropriate
version of the CM4000 controller from one of the following:
.RS 3m

On the \fBMotor\fP screen, select the \fBCM4000\fP controller type
for each motor to be controlled.
Motors are assigned to the CM4000 channels in the same order
they appear on the motor screen.
.SH "CONTROLLER SETUP"
.rs
.sp
You must program the RS\-232 baud rate or the
GPIB address using the Compumotor front panel controls
before trying to access it with \fBspec\fP.
You should consult the Compumotor manual for details,
but in brief, the procedure is as follows.
First enter the \fBACCESS\fP code (the factory default is \fB4000\fP).
Then choose the
\fBIMMED\fP function, and then the \fBDEFINE GPIB ADDR\fP statement to select the
the GPIB address.  Alternatively, choose the \fBIMMED\fP function, and the the
\fBRS232 PORT1\fP statement to configure the baud rate for the RS\-232 interface.
.sp
There are many other configuration options with this controller.
Other than the GPIB address and the baud rate, you should
probably not change any of these others.
You can reestablish the factory defaults using the
\fBRESET\fP function from the main menu.
.sp
Output pins 46 or 47 on the programmable output connector
can be used to gate a counter during powder\-mode scans.
While the powder\-mode motor is moving during these scans,
\fBspec\fP sets pin 46 high and pin 47 low.
Use the one appropriate for your particular counter.
To gate the Ortec 994 counter/timer, for example,
pin 46 and an even\-numbered pin (all are logic ground)
are connected to the front panel \fBenable\fP BNC connector on the Ortec module.
