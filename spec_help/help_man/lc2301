.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs

The LeCroy 2031 MCA is selected in the \fBconfig\fP file as
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBCA_2301 = slot_number\fP
.RE

When running \fBedconf\fP (or the \fBconfig\fP macro),
use the \fBCAMAC\fP screen to select this MCA module.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.rs
.sp
The \fBmca_par()\fP function controls the MCA module\(aqs behavior as follows:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("clear")\fP
\- 
clears the MCA.
\fBspec\fP inserts a 1.5 second delay to give the device time to clear.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("run")\fP
\- 
start the MCA.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("halt")\fP
\- 
stops the MCA.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("first_ch")\fP
\- 
returns the first channel to be read out.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("first_ch", value)\fP
\- 
sets the first channel to be read out to \fBvalue\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("npts")\fP
\- 
returns the number of channels to be read out.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("npts", value)\fP
\- 
sets the number of channels to be read out to
\fBvalue\fP. The maximum number of channels is 1,024.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("delay")\fP
\- 
returns the delay time in seconds that \fBspec\fP
sleeps after the MCA is cleared.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("delay", value)\fP
\- 
sets the time for \fBspec\fP to delay after sending the clear command.
The hardware does require some delay.
Some users have reported 1.5 seconds are needed, others report
0.1 seconds is adequate.  The default value is 0.1 seconds.
