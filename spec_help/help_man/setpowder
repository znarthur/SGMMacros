.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBsetpowder\fP macro is used to turn the powder\-average mode on or off.
Its usage is:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBsetpowder motor full_width\fP
\- 
turns powder mode on, sets parameters.
.HP 5m
."
\fBsetpowder off\fP
\- 
turns powder mode off.
.HP 5m
."
\fBsetpowder uni\fP
\- 
turns unidirectional scanning on.
.HP 5m
."
\fBsetpowder \-uni\fP
\- 
turns bidirectional scanning on.
.HP 5m
."
\fBsetpowder\fP
\- 
turns powder mode on, asks for parameters.

.sp
When powder mode is on, the powder motor will be rocked the
full width specified at each point in a scan.
Counts will be accumulated while the motor is moving.
Powder mode works with all the angle scans and the \fBHKL\fP scans.
.sp
The syntax for invoking scans remains unchanged.
You must still give the count\-time parameter, although
its value is only used to select the order in which the time
and monitor counts
are recorded for each data point in the data file.
(In the future, the count\-time parameter may be used
to set the motor velocity.)
.sp
By default, the motors are rocked at the base rate as configured in the
\fBconfig\fP file.
To accommodate a faster rocking speed that requires
accelerating from a base rate or a powder speed
different from the base rate, the following
\fBmotor_par()\fP motor parameters
are available (as of \fBspec\fP release 5.05.05\-1):
\fB"powder_base"\fP, \fB"powder_slew"\fP and \fB"powder_acceleration"\fP.
The values for the first two parameters are set to the motor base
rate and the last to the motor acceleration
when \fBspec\fP starts up and on every
\fBreconfig\fP command (or \fBconfig\fP macro invocation).
If the \fB"powder_slew"\fP value is less than the
\fB"powder_base"\fP value
both the base and slew rates are set to the
\fB"powder_slew"\fP value.
.sp
(Certain motor controllers,
namely the 18011, CM3000, CM4000,
E500, ES_OMS, ES_VPAP, HUB9000, IP28,
MC4, MCB, SIX19, SMC and XRGCI_M,
do not recognize the above parameters.
Contact CSS to discuss the feasibility of adding support for the
parameters for any of these controllers.)
.sp
By default, the powder mode moves the rocked motor in opposite directions
at successive points to save time.
If unidirectional mode is selected, the motor is scanned in the same
direction for each point with the direction determined by the sign
of the \fBfull_width\fP parameter.
The motor movements do not include backlash corrections in either case.
At the end of the scan, or if the scan is aborted,
the rocked motor will be returned to its position at the start of the scan,
correcting for backlash, as of the powder\-mode macros included in
\fBspec\fP release 5.06.01\-4.
Prior to that,
the rocked motor would be left at its last position
without a backlash correction.
.sp
Powder mode works by redefining the macros
\fBscan_move\fP and \fBscan_count\fP that are called at each point in a scan.
The return to starting position of the rocked motor is
accomplished using the \fBcleanup_once\fP and \fBspec_scan_tail\fP macros.
