.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
These notes describe how to download and install \fBspec\fP.
.SH "PREPARATION"
.rs
.sp
To helps keep the files associated with \fBspec\fP organized,
CSS recommends creating a user account on your machine named
\fBspecadm\fP that will own the \fBspec\fP files.
We also recommend that the distribution files associated with
each version of \fBspec\fP be placed in a subdirectory named after the
release number in the home directory of \fBspecadm\fP.
For example, if installing \fBspec\fP release 5.09.02\-2
and if the home directory of \fBspecadm\fP is
\fB/home/specadm\fP, then the \fBspec\fP distribution
might be placed in a directory named
\fB/home/specadm/spec5.09.02\fP. The downloaded distribution
"tarball" files might be stored in a separate directory, such as
\fB/home/specadm/dist/\fP.
.SH "DOWNLOADING"
.rs
.sp
\fBspec\fP is distributed as a \fBtar\fP format file,
usually retrieved from the certif.com server
using http.  One generally receives emailed instructions on the exact
path name to access a particular \fBspec\fP distribution from the http server.
Distributions can only be retrieved by name, as
the contents of the distribution directory are hidden.
.sp
Assuming the recommended locations, the usual procedure
for downloading the \fBspec\fP distribution is as follows:
.sp
.RS 4m
.nf
\fBcd /home/specadm/dist\fP
\fBwget http://certif.com/css_dist/spec_distver.tar\fP
.fi
.sp
.RE
.sp
The \fBdistver\fP part of the file name will be unique to each download and
will include the release version number.
If you don\(aqt have the \fBwget\fP utility, you can try to save the file
from a web browser.
.SH "EXTRACTING"
.rs
.sp
Use commands along the following lines to extract the
\fBspec\fP distribution from the
\fBtar\fP file:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
cd /home/specadm
mkdir spec5.09.02             (for release 5.09.02)
cd spec5.09.02
tar xvf ../dist/spec_distver.tar
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.SH "INSTALLING"
.rs
.sp
When updating a previous installation of \fBspec\fP,
copy the \fBinstall_data\fP file from the previous distribution directory
to the current distribution directory.
That will save having to retype the same responses to the
configuration questions.
.sp
On a PC, with a hardware configuration that uses ISA or PCI cards, the
\fBInstall\fP program needs to be run as the super user (root).
In other cases, it isn\(aqt necessary to run as root, but the user
running the script needs to have permission to write files in the
target directories.
.sp
Some of the following \fBInstall\fP options may be of interest.
.sp
.RS 4m
.TS
;
l l .
\fB\-d\fP	Use the default parameters from \fBinstall_data\fP
\fB\-p\fP	Do a partial installation (geometry\-dependent stuff)
\fB\-s\fP	Just compile the geometry target
\fB\-S\fP	Do not require root access to install
.TE
.RE
.sp
To run the script, type \fBInstall [options]\fP (or
\fB./Install [options]\fP if the current directory isn\(aqt in your path).
.sp
The \fI\%config_adm\fP help file explains how to setup up the site configuration.
In particular, sections at the end of the help file describe
how to set up special \fBlinked configurations\fP and
\fBextra protection\fP features.
.sp
You should also check the \fBREADME\fP files
in the \fBspec\fP distribution directory and the
\fBaux\fP subdirectory for additional information.
