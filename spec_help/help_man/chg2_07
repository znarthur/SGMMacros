.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
These notes summarize the modifications made for \fBspec\fP release 2.7,
as finalized on July 8, 1988.
.SH "CHANGES"
.rs
.sp
GPIB support for the Tecmar board in the AT is now included.
The user must have read and write permission for
\fB/dev/iomem\fP.
The board must be installed at base address 300.
If the
\fBconfig\fP
file assigns a slot to the Kinetic Systems
3388 GPIB CAMAC module, the Tecmar
board will be unavailable.
.sp
A presence test is performed when the E500 is first opened and
when the user types
\fBsync\fP
or
\fBreconfig\fP.
(\fBreconfig\fP
is called by the
\fBconfig\fP
macro.)
If
the presence test fails, all associated motors are marked
\fBunusable\fP.
Once marked unusable, the program must be restarted to make them
usable.
Trying to move an
unusable
motor produces an error
message.
.sp
The E500
\fB"remaining steps"\fP,
usually resulting from aborting motion,
are noted and cleared in the LAM routine.
Thus
\fB"clearing remaining steps"\fP
messages seldom occur when
initiating a move.
.sp
When there is a discrepancy between
\fBprivileged\fP
motor settings and
the controller registers, the registers are now changed, rather than
the settings.
.sp
When there is a discrepancy between
\fBwritable\fP
motors and controller
settings, the user must type either
\fBy\fP
or
\fBn\fP.
No
default is allowed.
(\fBY\fP
or
\fB1\fP
and
\fBN\fP
or
\fBn\fP
are also acceptable input.)
.sp
The
\fBgetangles\fP
and
\fBgetdials\fP
commands now read and
return the current contents
of the controller registers, not the program\(aqs idea of the
motor positions.
(However, at present, the program\(aqs idea of the motor position is not
changed by these two commands\-that still occurs the same way as in
previous versions.)
.sp
\fBSIMULATE\fP
is no longer a built\-in variable.
Instead, a new function,
\fBset_sim()\fP
is used to turn simulation mode on and off, where
\fBset_sim(0)\fP
turns
the mode off and
\fBset_sim(1)\fP
turns the mode on.
Both wait for moving and
counting to finish before changing the mode, and both return the previous
mode.
\fBset_sim(\-1)\fP
returns the current value of simulation mode without
changing it.
Whenever simulation mode is turned off, the motor
settings file is reread to restore the motor positions.
.sp
Negative arguments to
\fBsleep()\fP
are allowed.
They represent clock ticks, where a clock tick is
1/60th of a second, e.g.,
\fBsleep(\-10)\fP
pauses for approximately a sixth of
a second.
.sp
\fBmove\fP
has been renamed
\fBmove_all\fP
to make it harder for a user
to start motors moving by accident.
.sp
\fBedconf\fP
has been revised, due to popular demand.
Changes include the following:
When invoked with the
\fB\-s\fP
option,
\fBedconf\fP
is put into simulation mode where nothing
can be changed and files can\(aqt be written.
Also, if the user doesn\(aqt have write permission to the
\fBconfig\fP
file, no
configuration parameters can be changed, and only the settings and/or
limits of the configured
\fBwritable\fP
motors can be changed.
System error messages are now shown giving the reason for failures
when opening, closing, reading and writing the files.
Also, the motor settings can now be put outside the limits, although
a warning message
will be printed when the user writes out the files.
The dial setting is now
maintained when changing the number\-of\-steps parameter.
Finally, there is always at least one motor.
.sp
The tweak macro
\fBtw\fP
has been changed to only output to the printer at
the beginning and end of the tweaking process.
.sp
The
\fBset_dial\fP
macro no longer changes the limits.
However the macro
refuses to set the dial outside of the current limits.
.sp
The format of motor positions written to the data file by the scan
macros has been compressed.
The motor names are no longer printed.
The motor positions are printed eight per line with the format
.sp
.RS 4m
\fB#P0 (eight motors)\fP
.sp
\fB#P1 (another eight motors)\fP
.RE
.sp
etc.
.sp
The
\fBconfig\fP
macro invokes
\fBedconf\fP
with the
\fB\-s\fP
flag if \fBspec\fP is in
simulation mode.
.sp
New macros display motor positions while motors are moving.
Their names are
\fBuwm\fP,
\fBumv\fP,
\fBumvr\fP,
\fBuan\fP,
\fBupl\fP,
\fBubr\fP
and
\fBumk\fP.
Except for
the update feature, they are identical to
\fBwm\fP,
\fBmv\fP,
\fBmvr\fP,
\fBan\fP,
\fBpl\fP,
\fBbr\fP
and
\fBmk\fP.
The global variable
\fBUPDATE\fP
contains the sleep time between screen
updates and can be changed by the user.
.sp
The Makefile for installing \fBspec\fP has a new variable
\fBPERMS\fP
that contains
the permissions to assign to the
\fBconfig\fP
file.
The default is to make
the config file writable by everyone.
(Typing
\fBmake install_x20\fP
will install the BNL X20
\fBspec\fP
automatically giving the
\fBconfig\fP
file restricted access.)
.sp
A bug whereby
CAMAC interrupts that arrived during a
\fBsleep()\fP
sometimes caused the
\fBsleep()\fP
to not wake up is fixed.
A bug whereby assigning string values to the motor position array,
\fBA[]\fP,
used to
produce surprising results is fixed.
