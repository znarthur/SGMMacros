.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.rs
.sp
\fBhistory [n|\-n]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBhistory\fP command lists the 1000 most recently entered commands.
With the option \fBn\fP, only the \fBn\fP most recent commands are listed.
A \fB\-n\fP lists the commands in reverse order.
.sp
The history is saved when \fBspec\fP exits and restored when
\fBspec\fP restarts with the same state files.
.sp
The rest of this document describes the CSS\-provided
version of the history syntax.
If your site administrator has chosen to include the optional GNU
\fBreadline\fP history code when \fBspec\fP was installed, refer to the
\fBreadline\fP help file, instead.
.sp
The history feature lets you recall previous commands.
The syntax is a subset of that of the
\fBcsh\fP history command.  Examples of the recognized syntax are:
.sp
.RS 4m
.nf
\fB!!\fP   \- redo the previous command.
\fB!14\fP  \- redo command number 14.
\fB!\-2\fP  \- redo the second to previous command.
\fB!asc\fP \- redo the last command that began with \fBasc\fP.
\fB!asc \-10000\fP  \- As above and append \fB\-10000\fP to the command.
.fi
.sp

.sp
The command number is prepended to the \fBspec\fP prompt as an aid
in using the history feature.
Only commands typed at the keyboard are remembered for history,
and no more than 1000 commands are retained.
The history feature cannot be used in command files.
.sp
Command recall must occur at the beginning of a line.
Text may follow the command\-recall word to extend that command.
.sp
Appending \fB:s/left/right/\fP to a recalled command
will modify the first occurrence of
the string \fBleft\fP in the recalled command to the characters
\fBright\fP. The delimiter of the left and right strings may be any character.
The final delimiter is optional.
If \fBleft\fP is empty, the last entered left string
is used as the pattern to match.
.sp
In addition, \fB^left^right^\fP at the start of a line is shorthand for
\fB!\-1:s/left/right/\fP.
In this case, the circumflex (\fB^\fP)
must be used as the delimiter.  The final delimiter is optional.
