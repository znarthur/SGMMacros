The X\-Ray Instrumentation Associates Huber Slit Controller
Model HSC\-1 is a specialized device only used to control
Huber slits.
The HSC\-1 communicates through a serial port, and several
HSC\-1 modules can be daisy\-chained together and run off
a single serial port.

The controller is selected on the \fBedconf\fP devices screen along the lines of:

The HSC\-1 module needs to be sent a calibration command
before the HSC\-1 motors can be moved with the normal move commands.
The HSC\-1 manual describes a manual calibration procedure.
It is also possible to set the controller to the calibrated state by
sending the \fB"calibrate"\fP command with \fBmotor_par()\fP as described below.
.sp
Each HSC\-1 contains two motors that control the slit blades.
Each blade can be moved independently.
The HSC\-1 also implements commands to move both blades simultaneously
to change either the gap or the center\-of\-the\-gap position.
\fBspec\fP can be configured to control just the two blades, just the
gap and the center position, or all four motions.
When all four motions are configured,
moving either blade changes the positions reported for gap and center, and
moving either the gap or the center causes the positions reported
for each blade to change.
.sp
Configuration for the HSC\-1 requires the unit/channel field on
the second line of the motor screen of the configuration editor
to be filled in according to
the following special format.
The unit number corresponds to successive
entries on the devices screen \-
each unit is associated with a different serial port.
Unit numbers start with zero for the first HSC\-1 entry.
The channel number combines two values.
Each HSC\-1 module requires an arbitrary module number \fBN\fP (see below).
This number is multiplied by 10 and added to the channel number that
identifies the motion, as follows:
For motor controller \fBN\fP, channel \fBN\fP*10 + 0 corresponds to blade A,
channel \fBN\fP*10 + 1 corresponds to blade B,
channel \fBN\fP*10 + 2 corresponds to the gap
and channel \fBN\fP*10 + 3 corresponds to the center of the gap.
Channel numbers ending in 4 through 9 are invalid.
.SH "ENTERING THE SERIAL NUMBER"
.rs
.sp
The module number \fBN\fP (see above) is used only for internal bookkeeping and
does not designate a particular HSC\-1 module.  Each module
is identified by a thirteen\-character unique serial number of the form
\fBXIAHSC\-B\-0014\fP.
The serial number needs to be entered
as a string in the field \fBgeneric parameter 1\fP
on the optional motor\-parameter screen of the configuration editor.
Use the \fBm\fP command twice from the motor screen of the
configuration editor to
reach the screen where you can enter \fBgeneric parameter 1\fP.
Type an initial single quote
\fB\(aq\fP to enter a string.  Note, the serial number can also be entered as
\fBB\-0014\fP, \fB0014\fP or \fB14\fP if such a string
is sufficient to distinguish among modules.
Also note, the serial number should be entered
for just one of the motors associated with module \fBN\fP.
.sp
If the alias feature of the HSC\-1 is used,
and bit 6 of the \fBcontrol word\fP (see below) is set for
"use alias as ID", enter the alias rather than the serial number
as \fBgeneric parameter 1\fP.
Note, \fBspec\fP requires there be no space characters in the alias.
Setting and changing aliases requires establishing
serial communication with the modules, which may be difficult for
novice \fBspec\fP administrators, so
CSS recommends simply using the serial numbers as they exist
in the factory configuration.
.sp
Note, some users have reported that the serial numbers burned
into the firmware don\(aqt quite match those stamped on the casing, and also are
sometimes less than 13 characters.
When \fBspec\fP does the hardware configuration on start up or on a
\fBreconfig\fP, serial numbers found on the connected slit controllers, but not
entered in the \fBconfig\fP file will be listed (as of release 5.05.02\-7).
(On earlier \fBspec\fP releases, setting the debug level to 128
will display messages from the slit controllers
showing all the serial numbers.)
.SH "MOTOR PARAMETERS"
.rs
.sp
The \fBsteps per deg/mm\fP parameter should be set to 400 for the HSC\-1 modules.
.sp
Normally, the positions for each blade become more positive
as the blade is opened.  However, if the
\fBsign of user * dial\fP parameter is negative for either blade (or both),
the motor position will become more negative as the blade opens.
The sense of the center\-of\-the\-gap motion can also be changed by
changing the sign of the \fBsign of user * dial\fP parameter.
The gap motion is always positive as the gap increases, though.
.sp
The backlash, speed and acceleration parameters
in the \fBconfig\fP file are ignored.
.sp
CSS recommends using the calibration feature
of the HSC modules to set the zero positions, rather than using the
\fBset\fP macro to set the user \fBoffset\fP parameter.
That is, it is best to keep the user and dial positions the same.
The \fBchg_dial()\fP function will, in fact, send the
"immediate calibration" command to the controller,
but only when setting the position to zero.
Note, the gap should be physically at zero before using \fBset_dial\fP.
Use of the standard \fBset_dial\fP macro should be followed
by the \fBset\fP macro to set the user\-dial offset back to zero.
.sp
The HSC\-1 controller stores a number of parameters in nonvolatile memory.
\fBspec\fP will read and display them with the command
\fBmotor_par(motor, "dump")\fP, where \fBmotor\fP is the mnemonic
for any of the motions on the particular HSC\-1 module.
The display format is as follows:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
1    Outer motion limit (rw) = 4400 (11 mm)
2       Origin position (rw) = 400 (1 mm)
3      Motor A position (ro) = 900 (2.25 mm)
4      Motor B position (ro) = 900 (2.25 mm)
5      Motor step delay (rw) = 200 (roughly 0.272 mm/sec)
6         Gear backlash (rw) = 10 (0.25 mm)
7          Control word (rw) = 142 (0x8e)
8      Escape character (rw) = 33
9  Arbitration priority (rw) = 8
10        Motor A phase (ro) = 0
11        Motor B phase (ro) = 0

These parameters can be modified using a command such as

.SH "SPECIAL COMMANDS"
.rs
.sp
The \fBmotor_par()\fP options implemented for the HSC\-1 are as follows:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "calibrate")\fP
\- 
Sends the "immediate calibration" command to the unit.
The effect is to set the current position of each blade
in the controller to the \fBorigin\fP parameter.
It also sets \fBspec\fP\(aqs positions for the gap, center and blades to zero.
Thus the gap should physically be at zero before sending this command.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "origin" [, value])\fP
\- 
Sets the controller\(aqs \fBorigin\fP parameter
(parameter 2 of the controller\(aqs memory map) to
\fBvalue\fP. The units of \fBvalue\fP are steps,
where 400 steps corresponds to 1 mm.
The origin parameter determines how far beyond
the zero position each slit blade can be moved.
Note, changing the origin parameter will change the setting
of the current position of the blades.
The blades should thus be both at zero before sending
the \fB"origin"\fP command, and a
\fB"calibrate"\fP command should be sent immediately afterwards.
The factory default value for \fBorigin\fP is 400.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "range" [, value])\fP
\- 
Sets the controller\(aqs "outer limit" parameter
(parameter 1 of the controller\(aqs memory map) to
\fBvalue\fP, where the units of \fBvalue\fP are steps.
This parameter controls how far each blade can be moved.
The factory default value for this parameter is 4400.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "step+")\fP or \fBmotor_par(motor, "step\-")\fP
\- 
Moves blade A or blade B one step in the specified direction.
This command can be used to position the slits whether or not they
have been calibrated.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "send", cmd)\fP
\- 
Sends the string \fBcmd\fP to the HSC\-1 unit associated with \fBmotor\fP.
The module serial number will be included automatically.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "read", cmd)\fP
\- 
Sends the string \fBcmd\fP to the HSC\-1 unit associated with \fBmotor\fP,
as above, and returns a string containing the response.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "usend", cmd)\fP
\- 
Sends the string \fBcmd\fP to the serial port connected
to the HSC\-1 unit associated with \fBmotor\fP. The
\fBcmd\fP must include the full HSC\-1 command syntax.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "uread", cmd)\fP
\- 
Sends the string \fBcmd\fP to the serial port connected
to the HSC\-1 unit associated with \fBmotor\fP, as above,
and returns a string containing the response.
