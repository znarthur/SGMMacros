The first version of \fBspec\fP was developed in early 1986 at Harvard University
by Gerald Swislow (post doc) and Alan Braslau (grad student)
in the laboratory of Peter Pershan to control a two\-circle spectrometer
and two variations on a liquid\-surface spectrometer
using PDP 11/34 and 11/73 computers.

Certified Scientific Software began
development of the new \fBspec\fP in November, 1987.
