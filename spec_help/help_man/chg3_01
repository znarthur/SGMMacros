.SH "RELEASE 3.01.06"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.01.06 as of December 18, 1994.
.SH "\fBmca_sel()\fP Changes"
.sp
The
\fBreconfig\fP
command no longer performs an automatic
\fBmca_sel(0)\fP,
unless the currently selected MCA\-type device is no longer configured.
Also,
\fBmca_sel()\fP
now returns the number of selectable MCA\-type devices when passed
a valid argument.
.SH "Block\-Mode CAMAC Transfer Implementation"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now has its first implementation of CAMAC block\-mode transfers
for reading MCA\-type CAMAC modules.
Currently, block mode is only implemented for the Kinetic Systems 3929
SCSI CAMAC controller on HP platforms using either the Kinetic Systems
software or the CSS software.
Currently, only the LeCroy 3588 Histogramming Memory Module makes
use of block\-mode transfers.
Other CAMAC controllers and CAMAC MCA modules will be converted
to use block mode transfers in the future.
.SH "New \fBmca_put()\fP Function"
.sp
A new function
\fBmca_put(g, e)\fP
is available to load values from \fBspec\fP data group
\fBg\fP,
element
\fBe\fP
into the currently selected MCA.
Currently, this function is only implemented for
the LeCroy 3588 Histogramming Memory Module.
.SH "New \fBdata_info()\fP Function"
.sp
The new
\fBdata_info(grp, s)\fP
function returns data group configuration information.
See the
\fBdata\fP
help file for more information.
.SH "Comments Allowed In \fBdata_read()\fP Files"
.sp
The
\fBdata_read()\fP
function will now ignore lines in the input file
that begin with the character
\fB#\fP.
.SH "Motors and Counters Can Be Disabled for \fBcdef()\fP"
.sp
A new
option for the
\fBcounter_par()\fP
and
\fBmotor_par()\fP
functions allows individual motors and counters to be disabled,
presently, only for the purposes of having portions of a
\fBcdef()\fP
macro keyed to the motor or counter mnemonic selectively
included or excluded in the
\fBcdef()\fP\-macro
definition.
The function
\fBmotor_par(mot, "disable", [1|0])\fP
disables the motor
\fBmot\fP
if the third argument is nonzero.
Otherwise a disabled motor is enabled.
If only two arguments are present, the functions returns 0 if the
motor is enabled and 1 if the motor is disabled.
A \-1 is returned if the
\fBmot\fP
is not a valid motor.
Rereading the
\fBconfig\fP
file reenables all motors and counters.
Similar syntax applies to
\fBcounter_par().\fP
In the near future, motors and counters that are disabled will not
be accessed by \fBspec\fP.
.SH "The Nucleus PCA\-3 Supported and PCA\-Multiport Improved"
.sp
The Oxford/Tennelec/Nucleus PCA\-3 multichannel analyzer PC
board is now supported in \fBspec\fP.
This board is a replacement for the PCA II, and is the board of the choice
for new purchases.
Unlike the PCA II, the PCA\-3 does not require a kernel driver
to count to presets or perform dead\-time correction.
In addition, \fBspec\fP now includes
additional functionality for the PCA Multiport module.
See the
\fBpca\fP
help file for more information.
.SH "Support For KS 3116 16\-bit D/A"
.sp
The Kinetic Systems 3116 16\-bit can now be used as a DAC motor.
.SH "E/ISA Bus Support On HP 700"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports E/ISA port access on suitably equipped HP 700
platforms.
\fBspec\fP\(aqs port access functions
\fBport_get()\fP,
\fBport_put()\fP,
etc., and the built\-in support for all the PC card motor controllers,
counters, etc., that don\(aqt require a driver on PC UNIX systems,
are now available on the HP.
See the file
\fBaux/README.hp\fP
for information on setting up the system configuration files.
.SH "National Instruments GPIB now supported on HP 700"
.sp
\fBspec\fP can be linked with National Instruments GPIB support modules
(\fBcib.o\fP files)
on HP 700 platforms.
Currently, only the GPIB\-ENET module and software has been tested.
.SH "Improved Support For the KS3929 SCSI\-To\-CAMAC on HP 700"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now includes
direct support for the KS3929 SCSI\-to\-CAMAC controller
on the HP 700 platforms.
It is no
longer necessary to purchase the expensive KS software package.
.SH "Can Use 19200 and 38400 To Indicate Baud Rate"
.sp
The strings
\fB19200\fP
and
\fB38400\fP
are now recognized by \fBspec\fP and the configuration editor as synonyms
for the baud rates previously specified by
\fBexta\fP
and
\fBextb\fP.
.SH "New Version Info File"
.sp
\fBspec\fP distributions now include a
\fBVersion\fP
file that contains version numbers for all the files used to create the
\fBspec\fP distribution.
This information should aid in the communication between CSS and local
\fBspec\fP administrators in determining exactly what version of the package
is installed.
.SH "vi\-Mode Code Now Included With GNU Readline Library"
.sp
The optional GNU readline library source code aggregated with
the \fBspec\fP distribution now also includes the modules to support
vi\-editing mode.
Use
\fBESC\-^J\fP
or
\fBESC\-^M\fP
to switch between emacs\- and vi\-editing modes while running \fBspec\fP.
To start up in vi\-editing mode, put the line
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
set editing\-mode vi
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
in the
\fB.spec_keys\fP
file in your home directory.
.SH "Bug In Creation Mode of \fBhdw_lock\fP Fixed"
.sp
A bug in the per\-diffractometer hardware\-locking feature, whereby
the initial copy of the
\fBhdw_lock\fP
file was created with the wrong access modes, has been fixed.
With the wrong modes, hardware locking would be in place only for the
same user who created the initial
\fBhdw_lock\fP
file.
The mode of existing
\fBhdw_lock\fP
files will be corrected when \fBspec\fP is updated.
To fix existing installations, change the mode of each
\fBuserfiles/hdw_lock\fP
file to 0666.
Per\-diffractometer hardware locking was introduced in \fBspec\fP release 3.00.07.
.SH "RELEASE 3.01.05"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.01.05 as of September 14, 1994.
.SH "Protection Against Funny Characters In File Names"
.sp
\fBspec\fP can now optionally prevent you from (accidentally) creating files
with names containing nonstandard characters.
By default, this protection is enabled.
Use the function
\fBspec_par("check_file_names", 0)\fP
to disable the feature.
When the feature is enabled, if a file name passed to the
\fBon()\fP
or
\fBopen()\fP
functions contains any of the characters
\fB()[]{}|$\(aq\(ga*?;!&<>\e@\fP,
the space character, any
control characters or any characters with the eighth bit set,
and the file doesn\(aqt already exist,
\fBspec\fP will print a error messages and reset to command level.
.SH "Some Old Problems In Four\-Circle Phi\-Fixed Mode Fixed"
.sp
Some singularities in the angle calculations in phi\-fixed mode for
the four\-circle geometry, particularly at
\fBphi\fP
= 0, are now avoided.
.SH "Fixed Some Recent Bugs In the Installation Program"
.sp
Versions of the \fBspec\fP installation script dating from April 1994 until now
weren\(aqt installing the high\-resolution filter programs properly.
That bug has been fixed.
.SH "Some Fixes To \fBx\fP\-axis Labels In Plots"
.sp
A bug in the automatic ranging of the
\fBx\fP\-axis
numbering for reversed ranges that caused the ranges not to
encompass all the data points has been fixed.
In addition, incomplete erasure of previous numbers when the
\fBx\fP\-axis
ranges change in updated plots has been mostly fixed.
.SH "Small Improvement to High\-Res Plot \fBy\fP\-Axis Labels"
.sp
The formatting of the
\fBy\fP\-axis
labels has been modified to prevent truncation of
long label strings.
.SH "Bug In Using Two High\-Res Filters Fixed"
.sp
A bug where not doing a
\fBplot_cntl("open")\fP
after a
\fBplot_cntl("filter2")\fP
could cause a segmentation violation has been fixed.
Now, when the second high\-resolution filter isn\(aqt explicitly opened,
ASCII plots will be drawn by the plotting functions when the second filter
is selected.
.SH "Bug In Data Group Code Fixed"
.sp
A difficult\-to\-manifest bug in the data group code
where the data points could become scrambled when
data groups were freed should now be fixed.
.SH "More Serial Devices Allowed"
.sp
The number of user\-level serial devices allowed in
\fBspec\fP has been increased from three to eight.
.SH "Small Improvement To Ortec 9XX Timer Code"
.sp
Code has been added to help prevent the Ortec timer from hanging when
operating in updated counting mode.
.SH "Bug In Ortec 994 Blind Timer Mode Code Fixed"
.sp
A bug, where when counting to monitor counts using the blind timer mode,
the number of elapsed seconds at the end of the count time was not
correctly estimated from the software clock, has been fixed.
.SH "Fix For ACS MCB\-4 Bug"
.sp
A bug in the Advanced Control Systems MCB\-4 motor controller, where the
controller occasionally and unexpectedly
sends a null byte at the start of a string has
been accommodated in \fBspec\fP.
.SH "Support For the MicroControle ITL09 Motor Controller"
.sp
Initial support for the MicroControle ITL09 motor controller
on GPIB and RS\-232C interfaces
is now available.
.SH "Optional Angular Unit Parsing Available"
.sp
The command
\fBspec_par("parse_units", 1)\fP
enables parsing of unit suffixes.
By default, unit\-suffix parsing is disabled.
Numbers typed as input to \fBspec\fP\(aqs parser
with one of suffixes in the table below appended will automatically
be multiplied
by the corresponding factor.
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
1r  = 57.2958      radian
1mr = 0.0572958    milliradian
1d  = 1            degree
1md = 0.001        millidegree
1mm = 1            millimeter
1um = 0.001        micrometer
1m  = 0.0166667    minute
1s  = 0.000277778  second
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
Note, however,
suffixes on numbers converted from strings or entered using the
\fBgetval()\fP
function are not parsed.
The only known use for unit\-suffix parsing is with
the user\-contributed macros in
the file
\fBmacros/units.mac\fP.
These macros
require that unit suffixes be supplied
for all motor position arguments in the standard \fBspec\fP macros.
.SH "\fBSPECD\fP Environment Variable Used By Utilities"
.sp
The utilities
\fBshowscans\fP
and
\fBtidy_spec\fP
will now use the value of the environment variable
\fBSPECD\fP,
if it is set.
.SH "\fBtidy_spec\fP Revised"
.sp
The
\fBtidy_spec\fP
utility that reports on and cleans up user state files has been revised
so that any user can use the utility to report on state\-file disk
usage and clean up one\(aqs
own state files.
The owner of \fBspec\fP\(aqs auxiliary file directory (normally
\fBspecadm\fP)
and the super user may clean up anybody\(aqs state files using
\fBtidy_spec\fP.
Type
\fBtidy_spec \-\fP
from the shell to see
\fBtidy_spec\fP\(aqs
usage.
.SH "RELEASE 3.01.04"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.01.04 as of June 12, 1994.
.SH "New \fBmotor_num()\fP and \fBcnt_num()\fP Functions"
.sp
New functions
\fBmotor_num(mne)\fP
and
\fBcnt_num(mne)\fP
that return the motor or counter number corresponding
to the mnemonic or number given as as argument have been added.
If no motor or counter is configured with the given mnemonic, the function
returns \-1.
The argument can either be a string or a number.
.SH "New Automatic Hardware Polling"
.sp
On platforms with polled motor controllers, timers or acquisition devices,
\fBspec\fP can now automatically poll the devices to determine when they are
finished.
The polling occurs while waiting for keyboard input at the main prompt.
When using the GNU readline library, the polling occurs while waiting for
each character to be typed.
When using the standard \fBspec\fP history, the polling occurs only before the
first character is typed.
Automatic hardware polling can be disabled using the
\fB"auto_hdw_poll"\fP
option to the new
\fBspec_par()\fP
function described below.
.SH "New \fBspec_par()\fP Function To Set Internal Parameters"
.sp
A new function
\fBspec_par(option [, value])\fP
is available to set miscellaneous internal operating parameters of \fBspec\fP.
Typing
\fBspec_par("?")\fP
lists the available parameters and their current values.
Option settings are saved in the state file.
.SH "Default Plot Options Changed"
.sp
The startup default colors for high resolution plots have been changed
from those appropriate to VGA terminals to those appropriate for X11
windows.
You can still type
\fBdef_colors\fP
after the global variable
\fBGTERM\fP
has been set to select the default colors appropriate to the current
graphics device.
Also, the startup default plotting options have been changed to enable
low\-resolution screen plots during and after each scan and to disable
printer plots after each scan.
.SH "Renamed Startup Macro File"
.sp
The name of
one of the startup macro files that \fBspec\fP will read if it exists has been
changed from
\fBconf/site.mac\fP
to
\fBconf/conf.mac\fP,
where the directory
\fBconf\fP
is the name by which \fBspec\fP was invoked, while the second
\fBconf\fP
is literal.
.SH "New \fBcdef\fP Function"
.sp
A new function to create
\fB"chained"\fP
macros has been introduced.
See the
\fBfuncs\fP
help file for more information.
.SH "Improvements Made In \fBwait()\fP"
.sp
Previously, the
\fBwait()\fP
function would poll all busy devices, even when asked to wait for only
moving or counting to finish.
Now, only hardware that is busy doing that which
\fBwait()\fP
is being asked to wait for will be polled.
.SH "New \fBquit\fP Command"
.sp
There is now a command called
\fBquit\fP
that will cause \fBspec\fP
to terminate, just as
\fB^D\fP
does.
The command must be at the beginning of a line either typed on the
keyboard or read from a command file.
Including
\fBquit\fP
in a macro definition will not work.
.SH "New Workaround To Configure Extra Devices"
.sp
Some installations require more motor controllers or serial devices
than \fBspec\fP\(aqs configuration editor
\fBedconf\fP
allows.
Now
\fBedconf\fP
has been changed so that
\fBspec\fP administrators can add extra devices to the
\fBconfig\fP
file by hand.
Although the extra devices won\(aqt appear on the
\fBedconf\fP
screens,
they won\(aqt be eliminated from the
\fBconfig\fP
file as before, and will be available to \fBspec\fP.
Eventually,
\fBedconf\fP
will be upgraded to handle as many
devices as needed.
.SH "Code For Scientific Solutions GPIB Board Improved"
.sp
The user\-level code in \fBspec\fP that drives the Scientific Solutions (Tecmar)
GPIB board has been tightened up and made to run faster.
Note that this is the only GPIB board supported on
\fBlinux\fP
platforms.
.SH "Code For Compumotor 4000 Motor Controller Improved"
.sp
Problems with the code for the Compumotor 4000 motor controller when running
on a GPIB interface faster CPUs have been fixed.
.SH "Support for Kinetic Systems 3512/3514 ADC"
.sp
The Kinetic Systems 3512/3514 16\-channel ADC CAMAC modules may now
be used as counters with \fBspec\fP.
When configuring these counters on the scaler screen of the
configuration editor, selecting a negative scale factor will
treat the ADC contents as twos\-complement data.
A positive scale factor means to treat the ADC contents as
unsigned binary data.
.SH "Driverless Support for KS 2926 CAMAC Controller"
.sp
Joining the trend of using user\-level, polled code rather than
kernel drivers for \fBspec\fP hardware devices, the Kinetic Systems
2926 can now be used in a driverless configuration.
The board interrupt should be disabled in this case.
.SH "Support For the NSK Megatorque Motor Controller"
.sp
The Nippon\-Seiko Megatorque DC motor controller is now
supported by \fBspec\fP over a RS\-232C interface.
.SH "Support For the Physik Instrumente DC Motor Controller"
.sp
The Physik Instrumente C\-804/C\-812 DC\-Motor Controller
is now supported by \fBspec\fP over a GPIB interface.
.SH "The \fBkappa\fP Geometry Is Now Usable"
.sp
The geometry code for the
\fBkappa\fP
configuration is now available.
.SH "Software Timer on SYSVR3 Platforms Improved"
.sp
The software timer on System V/386 3.2
now reports updated time with subsecond resolution.
Note, however,
the accuracy of alarms on the version of UNIX
fluctuates by almost a second.
.SH "More Install Options"
.sp
The
\fBInstall\fP
program now prompts for additional parameters relating to special
hardware options, namely whether an SICL GPIB driver is being used and
whether the Kinetic Systems SCSI\-CAMAC driver is being used.
.SH "Bug in \fBInstall\fP Fixed"
.sp
A bug in the new multiple geometry installation feature introduced
in the previous release, that made the feature not work if the
target name differed from the standard name,
has been fixed.
.SH "Bugs in MotionMaster 2000 Fixed"
.sp
A couple of bugs
in the most recent versions of the Klinger MotionMaster 2000 code
have been fixed.
.SH "\fBinput(0)\fP From Pipe Works"
.sp
The function
\fBinput(0)\fP
when used with \fBspec\fP invoked with the
\fB\-p\fP
flag can be used to see if any input characters are available on the
input pipe.
When the input is from the pipe, the function returns the number of
characters available to be read.
When the input if from the keyboard, the function returns the null string
if no characters are available, or the first character available if
the user has typed something.
.SH "Messages Used With the Pipe Input Option Changed"
.sp
The messages sent back to a program (such as a GUI) that run \fBspec\fP
through a pipe are being reorganized.
Contact CSS for details.
.SH "RELEASE 3.01.03"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.01.03 as of May 9, 1994.
.SH "New Macro Hooks Available"
.sp
New hooks into the standard macros are now available.
The macros
\fBwaitall\fP,
\fBwaitmove\fP
and
\fBwaitcount\fP
now include calls to
\fBuser_waitall\fP,
\fBuser_waitmove\fP
and
\fBuser_waitcount\fP
respectively.
These are defined as empty macros when \fBspec\fP starts fresh.
In addition, the new macros
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
def chk_move  \(aq(wait(0x21) || USER_CHK_MOVE)\(aq
def chk_count \(aq(wait(0x22) || USER_CHK_COUNT)\(aq
def chk_acq   \(aq(wait(0x24) || USER_CHK_ACQ)\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
replace the
\fBwait()\fP
calls in the updated moving and counting macros, with the new standard global
\fBUSER_CHK_\fP
variables available to the user.
Also, the
\fBmove_em\fP
macro is now defined by default to include the new user hook macros
as follows:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
def move_em \(aq
    user_premove
    move_all
    user_postmove
\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.SH "New \fBCOUNT_TIME\fP Global Variable"
.sp
The
\fBcount_em\fP
macro now saves the count time in the new standard global variable
\fBCOUNT_TIME\fP
to make the value available to any other interested macros.
The
\fBcount_em\fP
macro is the lowest level counting macro called by the standard macros.
.SH "Installation Now Supports Multiple Geometries"
.sp
\fBspec\fP\(aqs installation program now allows you to specify the geometries
and names of up to 32 configurations that are to be installed together.
One binary file will be created that includes the code for all the
specified configurations.
Each name configuration will be a hard link to that file.
.SH "More Plot Points Per Group"
.sp
The maximum number of total plot points per group has been increased
from 32,768 to 65,536.
The total number of points allowed in all groups is now 262,144.
.SH "Plot Points File Now Truncated When Starting Fresh"
.sp
The plot data file saved with the user\(aqs state file in the
\fBuserfiles\fP
directory is now truncated when the user starts fresh or when the data in
the file appears corrupted.
Previously, the file would have to be removed to decrease its size.
Note, the file can grow as large as the total number of allowed plot points
times the number of bytes per point.
For the default data format (single precision), the maximum
size is currently one megabyte per user state file.
.SH "New Serial Device Configuration Option"
.sp
To support serial devices that don\(aqt use the standard UNIX tty
interface, (such as a serial board in a VME crate accessed through
ESRF
\fBdev_putget()\fP
functions or
EPICS channel access), the configuration editor provides a new field
for serial devices.
For the traditional serial devices, the characters <> appear in the
field.
Other serial interfaces can be selected by stepping through the choices.
In the
\fBconfig\fP
file itself, the type of serial interface is indicated by
prepending characters such as
\fBESRF:\fP
or
\fBEPICS:\fP
to the device name.
.SH "RELEASE 3.01.02"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.01.02 as of March 31, 1994.
.SH "Closing X11 Plot Window From Window Manager Works"
.sp
Previously, it was necessary to type
\fBplot_cntl("kill")\fP
to clean up after closing the X11 plot window.
Also, it was often necessary to kill
\fBx11filt\fP
processes that were left over after closing the window.
\fBspec\fP now will automatically recreate the plot window the next time
data is plotted if the plot window has been closed or
killed from outside of \fBspec\fP.
Also, the processes that create the window now trap
\fB"window\-destroy"\fP
events and
are much more likely to exit no matter how the windows are closed.
.SH "GPIB Sharing Improved"
.sp
The code to
share one National Instruments board with multiple
copies of \fBspec\fP running on
the same computer has been improved, particularly with respect to
the code for the
GPIB\-to\-CAMAC controllers.
When a new process first accesses the GPIB driver, the driver resets the
board,
Although \fBspec\fP can not prevent that reset, the
error checking and command retry in \fBspec\fP has been much improved, eliminating
many of the problems observed by users.
.SH "Long Input Lines Won\(aqt Crash \fBspec\fP with \fBreadline\fP"
.sp
Previously, when using the optional GNU
\fBreadline\fP
command line editing and history library, input lines longer than 512
characters would cause \fBspec\fP to crash.
Now, input lines longer than 512 characters are safely truncated.
In the future, there will be no restriction on input line length.
.SH "New \fBstop()\fP Function"
.sp
A new hardware control function,
\fBstop(w)\fP,
has been introduced to synchronously halt
moving, counting or other asynchronous data acquisition.
If the bit corresponding to
\fBw\fP=1
is set, moving is halted.
if the bit corresponding to
\fBw\fP=2
is set, counting and other data acquisition is halted.
If
\fBw\fP
is zero or missing all asynchronous activity is halted.
.SH "New \fBatan2()\fP Function"
.sp
The math function
\fBatan2(y, x)\fP
returns the arc tangent of
\fBy/x\fP
using the signs of the arguments to determine the quadrant of the return
value.
The return value is in the range \-PI to PI.
.SH "New \fBport_putw()\fP and \fBport_getw()\fP Functions"
.sp
New functions for 16\-bit I/O port access on AT\-bus computers
are available.
.SH "New Motor Parameters"
.sp
The motor screen of the configuration editor now has additional
subscreens for entering optional motor parameters.
The optional parameters are used with some of the supported motor
controllers.
The parameter subscreens are accessed by typing the new
\fBm\fP
command.
Optional parameters are entered by typing in a value.
Parameters are deleted with the new
\fB^D\fP
command.
The additional parameters are added to the
\fBconfig\fP
file after the line that describes the basic motor parameters using:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
MOTPAR:dc_gain = 1500
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
All of these parameters can be changed or assigned with the
\fBmotor_par()\fP
function.
.SH "Klinger Motion Master 2000 Changes"
.sp
The Klinger Motion Master 2000 motor controller can now be used with
the PC port interface.
The
\fBconfig\fP
file identifiers has been changed from
\fBKL2000\fP
to
\fBMM2000\fP.
All of the optional parameters are now taken from the
\fBconfig\fP
file.
.SH "\fBy\fP\-axis Significant Digits Adjusted"
.sp
The number of significant digits shown on the
\fBy\fP\-axis
numbers is now automatically adjusted to match the range in
the data.
.SH "Help Links"
.sp
A new
\fB.links\fP
file in the help file directory is consulted by the
\fBgethelp()\fP
function for associating arbitrary topic names with an existing file.
.SH "ACS MCU2 Changes"
.sp
The
\fBslop\fP
parameter is now taken from the optional motor parameters available in
the
\fBconfig\fP
file.
.SH "Huber SMC 9000 Supported"
.sp
The Huber SMC 9000 GPIB motor controller is now supported.
.SH "RELEASE 3.01.01"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the changes made for \fBspec\fP
