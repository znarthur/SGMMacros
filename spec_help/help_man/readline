.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The GNU \fBreadline\fP library or the BSD
\fBlibedit\fP library may be optionally linked with \fBspec\fP during the \fBspec\fP
installation.
When \fBspec\fP is linked with either of these libraries, the following
command completion, history substitution
and command line editing features become availble.
.SH "COMMAND COMPLETION"
.rs
.sp
The \fB<tab>\fP key can be used to complete the current word being typed.
The completion is context sensitive.
If completion is asked for on the first word of a command, possible completions
are all of \fBspec\fP\(aqs built\-in keywords and currently defined macros.
.sp
Possible completion on words following the commands \fBlsdef\fP, \fBprdef\fP and
\fBundef\fP are the currently defined macros.
Possible completion on words following the commands \fBsyms\fP and
\fBunglobal\fP include all the current symbol names.
Completion on words following \fBlscmd\fP are the built\-in keywords.
Possible completions to \fBspec_par(\fP are the available
\fBspec_par()\fP options.
In all other cases, possible completions on words following the first word of
a command are all the file and directory names in the current
directory.
.sp
If only one completion is possible, typing the
\fB<tab>\fP key will generate the completion.
If a small number of completions are available, typing the
\fB<tab>\fP key twice will list them,
followed by a redisplay of the current input line.
If a large number of completions are possible, typing the
\fB<tab>\fP will generate a prompt asking if all should be displayed.
.SH "TILDE EXPANSION"
.rs
.sp
The sequences \fB~/\fP and \fB~any_user/\fP
will be replaced by the full path names for the current user\(aqs and
any user\(aqs home directory when those characters are used
in the arguments to the
\fBopen()\fP, \fBclose()\fP, \fBon()\fP, \fBoff()\fP,
\fBdofile()\fP, \fBqdofile()\fP, \fBfile_info()\fP,
\fBchdir()\fP and \fBunix()\fP functions.
The same applies when the tilde\-containing arguments
are passed to the functions through macros, such as through the standard
\fBnewfile\fP, \fBdo\fP, \fBcd\fP, \fBu\fP, etc. macros.
.sp
Note, as of \fBspec\fP release 5.04.04, tilde expansion is available
whether or not \fBspec\fP is linked with the command\-line editing libraries.
.SH "HISTORY SUBSTITUTION \- EVENT SPECIFIERS"
.rs
.sp
All or part of a previous command can be recalled for the current command
using a string starting with the \fB!\fP event specifier character.
The following event specifiers may appear anywhere in the input line.
.sp
.RS 4m
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fB!!\fP
\- 
The previous command.
.HP 5m
."
\fB!N\fP

.HP 5m
."
\fB!?string[?]\fP
\- 
The most recent command containing \fBstring\fP. The trailing
\fB?\fP is optional at the end of a line.
.RE
.RE
.SH "HISTORY SUBSTITUTION \- WORD DESIGNATORS"
.rs
.sp
Individual words from previous commands can be recalled by
adding a word designator to the event specifier.
A colon (\fB:\fP) separates the two components and
can be omitted if the word designator begins with the characters
\fB^\fP, \fB$\fP, \fB*\fP or \fB%\fP.
Words are numbered from the beginning of the line, starting with
a 0 (zero).
.sp
.RS 4m
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fB0\fP
\- 
The 0th word.
.HP 5m
."
\fBN\fP
\- 
The \fBN\fPth word.
.HP 5m
."
\fB^\fP
\- 
Word 1.  \fB!^\fP refers to word 1 of the previous command.
.HP 5m
."
\fB$\fP
\- 
The last word.  \fB!$\fP refers to the last word of the previous command.
.HP 5m
."
\fB%\fP
\- 
The word most recently matched by a \fB?string?\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBN\-M\fP
\- 
A range of words; \fB\-N\fP Abbreviates \fB0\-N\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fB*\fP
\- 
All of the words, except the 0th.  This is the same as
\fB1\-$\fP. If there is just one word (the 0th)
in the event, an empty string is substituted.
.HP 5m
."
\fBN*\fP
\- 
Same as \fBN\-$\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBN\-\fP
\- 
Same as \fBN\-$\fP, but doesn\(aqt include the last word.
.RE
.RE
.SH "HISTORY SUBSTITUTION \- MODIFIERS"
.rs
.sp
One or more modifiers may follow the optional word designator,
each preceded by a \fB:\fP, as follows:
.sp
.RS 4m
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fB#\fP
\- 
The entire command line typed so far.
.HP 5m
."
\fBh\fP
\- 
Remove a trailing path name component of the form \fB/pathname\fP.
.HP 5m

.HP 5m
."
\fBs/left/right[/]\fP
\- 
Substitute the first occurrence of the string \fBleft\fP with the string
\fBright\fP. The pattern delimiter can be any character.
An \fB&\fP character in \fBright\fP is replaced by \fBleft\fP, unless the
\fB&\fP is preceeded by a single backslash.
The trailing delimiter is optional
if \fBright\fP is at the end of the line.
.HP 5m
."
\fBg\fP
\- 
When used with \fBs\fP,
apply the substitution to each occurrence of the string \fBleft\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBp\fP
\- 
Print the new command but do not execute it.
.RE
.RE
.sp
The usage
\fB^left^right^\fP is shorthand for \fB!!:s/left/right/\fP.
.SH "COMMAND LINE EDITING"
.rs
.sp
The following special keys can be used to recall previous command lines
and to modify the current command line.
In addition to the control keys described below,
the up and down arrow keys move through the history, while the left and
right arrow keys move the cursor within the currently displayed line.
.sp
The command names listed for readline and libedit are the
names you would use in an optional key\-bindings file.
See the documentation for readline or libedit for information
on setting up their respective key bindings files.
\fBspec\fP will arrange for a key\-bindings file named
\fB.spec_keys\fP in the \fBspec\fP user\(aqs home directory to be loaded, if it exists.

The readline library is included with most modern \fBLinux\fP distributions.
In addition, sources can be retrieved from \fI\%ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline\fP
and installed on any platform supported by \fBspec\fP.
\fBspec\fP should link with all current and previous releases of readline.
\fBspec\fP is known to link with
readline versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.2a and 4.3.
.sp
A prebuilt version of the NetBSD libedit library is included with the
\fBspec\fP distribution in the \fBlibedit\fP subdirectory.
The official source respository for the NetBSD version is at
\fI\%http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/lib/libedit\fP.
Portable versions configurable for other platforms are available from
\fI\%http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline\fP,
although that site doesn\(aqt always have the most recent version.
The source for the prebuilt version included with the \fBspec\fP distribution
is available at \fI\%certif.com/downloads/extras\fP.
