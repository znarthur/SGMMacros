.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBbr\fP macro
is used to move the diffractometer to the reciprocal space coordinates
given by \fBH\fP, \fBK\fP and \fBL\fP.
.sp
The \fBubr\fP macro also moves the diffractometer, but provides an updated
display of the motor positions and corresponding reciprocal space
coordinates while the motors are moving.
The update interval, in seconds, is set by the global variable \fBUPDATE\fP.
.sp
\fBbr\fP is synonymous with \fBmk\fP.
