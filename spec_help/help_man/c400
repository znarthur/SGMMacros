.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The C400 Quad Pulse Counter/Detector Controller is four\-channel
counter/timer made by Pyramid Technical Consultants and distributed
by FMB Oxford.
\fBspec\fP uses the ASCII communication protocol
available currently only on the serial interface and
requires the controller have recent firmware (0.7.27.84 or later).
.sp
The C400 can be used with \fBspec\fP as counters gated by an external master
timer or as a master timer when counting to a time preset.
The hardware does not currently support counting to a monitor preset.
.sp
In addition, \fBspec\fP allows programming of the C400 parameters
for the high voltage output,
the analog voltage output and the
input discriminator levels
associated with each of the four channels.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.rs
.sp
The C400 is configured on the \fBD\fPevices screen along the following lines.

The default baud rate for the C400 is 115200.  The number of channels
is set to five, as in addition to the four counter channels, there is
a channel allocated for the elapsed time.
When selected as "Counters Only", the C400 should have the external
gate enabled and be hardware gated by another timer.
.sp
On the \fBS\fPcaler screen, choose \fBC400\fP as the device type.

The timebase channel should be assigned channel number zero.
The remaining channels are 1 through 4.
The scale factor for the timebase is ignored, as it
is fixed in the C code.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"

The following \fBcounter_par()\fP options are available.  The first group
are associated with the entire controller.  The \fBmne\fP argument
identifies the controller.

\fBcounter_par(mne, "send", message)\fP

Sends the string \fBmessage\fP to the C400 associated with the
counter \fBmne\fP.  If the message generates a response, use
the \fB"read"\fP option below.
.HP 5m

\fBcounter_par(mne, "read", message)\fP

Sends the string \fBmessage\fP to the C400 associated with the
counter \fBmne\fP and returns the response.
.HP 5m

Values for any of these parameters can be queried or set using the
command pass through options \fB"read"\fP and \fB"send"\fP above.
Changing the \fB"TRIG"\fP parameters or the \fB"CONF:ACCUM"\fP
or \fB"CONF:PER"\fP parameters can interfere with \fBspec\fP\(aqs operation
of the counter.  Other parameters of interest can be changed using
the following commands.
.RE
.HP 5m
."
\fBcounter_par(mne, "deadtime" [, value])\fP
\- 
Sets or returns the deadtime correction to be applied to the
incoming counts for all four channels on the C400 associated with the
counter \fBmne\fP.  The units are nanoseconds.
.HP 5m
."
\fBcounter_par(mne, "gate_enable" [, 1|0])\fP
\- 
Sets or returns whether or not to use an external gate for the C400
associated with counter \fBmne\fP.  The external
gate feature is only available when the controller is configured as
"Counters Only" (as opposed to "Counter/Timer") in the configuration
editor.  When enabled, \fBTRIG:MODE\fP is set to \fBEXTERNAL_START_STOP\fP.
\fBTRIG:SOUR:START\fP and \fBTRIG:SOUR:STOP\fP are set to \fBBNC\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBcounter_par(mne, "gate_polarity" [, 1|0])\fP
\- 
Sets or returns the gate polarity for the C400 associated with
counter \fBmne\fP.  A value of 0 gates on the rising edge.  A
value of 1 gates on the falling edge.  The setting is only meaningful
when the external\-gate mode is enabled.
.HP 5m

Sets or returns the value for the analog output associated with
channel \fBmne\fP.  The units are volts.
.HP 5m
."
\fBcounter_par(mne, "disc_high" [, value])\fP
\- 
Sets or returns the discriminator high level in volts for the channel
associated with \fBmne\fP.  The sign is configured
with \fB"disc_polarity"\fP below and ignored here.
Note, the value set must be higher than
the current \fB"disc_low"\fP setting.  The units are in volts.

Sets or returns the discriminator low level in volts for the channel
associated with \fBmne\fP.  The sign is configured
