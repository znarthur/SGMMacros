.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
\fBspec\fP supports counter/timer PC cards and USB devices based
on the Advanced Micro Devices Am9513 chip.
Although production of the original AMD chip ended
in 1995 (after twenty years), compatible chips
from other manufactures continued to be available for many years.
Unfortunately, as of late 2012 it appears production of the compatible
chips has ceased, and vendors have discontinued the counter/timer
products based on the chips.
The extremely cost\-effective
counter/timers based on the Am9513 chip will continue to be supported
by \fBspec\fP.
These devices work quite well, and if one can find a module
on a vendor\(aqs back shelf or in the second\-hand market, it would be
worth grabbing.
.sp
Counter/timer models supported by \fBspec\fP include:
Measurement Computing (formerly ComputerBoards)
model CIO\-CTR05/10/20 ISA cards, PCI\-CTR05/10/20HD PCI cards,
and the USB\-4300 series; Keithley\-Metrabyte Model CTM\-05/10 ISA cards,
Scientific Solutions Labmaster series ISA and PCI cards,
Kontron\(aqs PCIDCC5/20\-P PCI card.
.sp
The Am9513 chip contains five 16\-bit counters that can be programmed
in a wide range of configurations.
Although boards may contain more than one of the chips,
the first chip on the timer/counter board is used as the master timer.
\fBspec\fP\(aqs programming uses two of the counters
of the master timer for a 32\-bit detector counter, two for
a 32\-bit monitor counter and one for a 16\-bit elapsed time counter.
On boards with two or four chips, the
additional chips are each programmed for two more 32\-bit detector counters.
\fBspec\fP supports the Am9513 chip
as both a time preset counter using the \fBtcount()\fP function
or a monitor\-count preset using
\fBmcount()\fP.
.sp
Note, \fBspec\fP release 5.06.03 includes several updates to the Am9513 support.
With the update, more than one Am9513\-type card can be configured at a time,
where the additional cards must be configured as counters only.
Also, the code was changed to improve the timer gating, although
an additional jumper is required to make the change effective.
Previously, the timer was started in one instruction,
followed by another instruction that released the gate signal
that inhibited the counters.
In the new code, the timer will also be gated by the gate signal,
but only if the additional jumper from \fBoutput 1\fP to \fBgate 1\fP is installed.
(See the \fI\%HARDWARE CONFIGURATION\fP section below).
\fBspec\fP will test for the presence of the additional jumper.
If it is missing, \fBspec\fP will program the timer for no gate, as before,
and print a message suggesting the jumper be added.
.sp
Note also, \fBspec\fP release 5.09.02
includes several significant updates to Am9513 support.
The Am9513\-compatible counter/timer chips used by Measurement Computing
in PCI cards and USB devices
behave slightly differently than the original chips.
This difference prevented the chips working
in counting\-to\-monitor mode using \fBspec\fP\(aqs original code.
This release includes a work around in the \fBspec\fP support,
and counting\-to\-monitor mode now works.
.sp
In addition, \fBspec\fP release 5.09.02
includes \fBcounter_par()\fP commands to access the
digital I/O ports on all versions of the device.
See the \fBFUNCTIONS\fP section below.
.SH "SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION"
.rs
.sp
Use \fBspec\fP\(aqs configuration editor (\fBedconf\fP, normally invoked by the
\fBconfig\fP macro) to select the timer and to configure the scaler channels.
For ISA cards, enter the base address on the \fBDevice\fP screen.
For all cards, enter the number of counters to be used on the board:

Note that for the Labmaster board, the base address of the counter chip is
eight plus the base address of the board itself.
For PCI cards, the address is determined automatically.
The address field can be used to enter the serial number
of USB devices if more than one is to be configured.
If the address is zero, the USB devices will be assigned in the order found.
.sp
For each additional chip on a board, add 2 to the value in the \fBNUM\fP field.
.sp
If more than one PCI Am9513 board is installed, the unit numbers are
assigned to the boards, starting with unit 0, in the same
order as the PCI bus/slot/function IDs are assigned by the computer.
(The \fBLinux\fP command \fB/sbin/lspci\fP lists the PCI identifiers.)
.sp
As of \fBspec\fP release 5.06.03, the command

where \fBmne\fP is the mnemonic of a counter associated with a PCI Am9513 card,
will return a string containing the I/O base address
of the PCI counter/timer cards, which
may useful in writing macros that access other features of the card,
such as digital I/O, A/D converters, etc.
(With \fBspec\fP release 5.09.02,
the digital I/O is accessible via \fBcounter_par()\fP. See below.)

On the \fBScaler\fP screen, the channel assignments
must have the timebase as channel
0 and the monitor as channel 1, as shown below:

The timebase scale factor is ignored.  Counters on unit 0, channels 3 and 4
would only be available if there are at least two Am9513 chips on the card.
Counters on unit 1 correspond to a second Am9513 card.
.SH "HARDWARE CONFIGURATION"

Connect the detector to the input connector pin labeled
\fBsource 3\fP. Counts received from the monitor go to the pin labeled
\fBsource 5\fP. In addition, wire the connector pin labeled \fBoutput 1\fP to the pins
\fBgate 1\fP, \fBgate 2\fP, \fBgate 4\fP and \fBgate 5\fP.
(In the more recent Keithley\-Metrabyte CTM\-05A manual, the
\fBsource\fP pins are now labeled \fBACLKIN\fP, the
\fBoutput\fP pins are now labeled \fBATIMEROUT\fP, and the
\fBgate\fP pins are now labeled \fBAGATE\fP.)
.sp
For a two\- or four\-chip board, or for additional counter\-only boards,
additional detectors can be connected
to the \fBsource 3\fP and \fBsource 5\fP pins of the chips.  In addition, the
\fBoutput 1\fP from the first chip of the timer/counter board
must be connected to \fBgate 2\fP and \fBgate 4\fP of the additional chips.
.sp
The counter boards are accessed from user level
and are polled to determine when count intervals have elapsed.
Thus, interrupts should be disabled on the boards.
.sp
When counting to time, the resolution of the clock depends
on the length of the count interval.
The maximum count time is 71.5 minutes.  The time base resolution (in seconds)
is set according to the following table:
.sp
.RS 4m
.TS

0.00001	for	\fBt\fP < 0.6 sec

0.01	for	\fBt\fP < 655.35 sec (10.9 min)
0.0655	for	\fBt\fP < 71.5 min
.TE
.RE
.sp
When counting to monitor counts, the 0.01 second time base is used,
and the value returned for
the time channel will be corrected to account for the rollovers
that occur every 655.36 seconds.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.rs
.sp
The following \fBcounter_par()\fP options are available.
Note, some models have 8 bits each of input and output and some
models have 16 bits each.
Also, some models allow the output bit settings to be read,
while some models do not.
For models that do not allow reading of the output registers, \fBspec\fP
keeps track of the values that have been written, so that it is possible
to set and clear individual bits without disturbing settings on other bits.
Note, though, that after reinitializing the hardware during startup or
\fBreconfig\fP, the previous state of read\-only output registers will be lost.
.sp
The digital I/O is associated with a counter card or device,
not with a counter channel.
However, the \fBspec\fP \fBcounter_par()\fP function
requires a counter\-channel argument.
In the calls below, \fBmne\fP is any counter channel associated
with the particular card or device
having the digital I/O ports being addressed.
