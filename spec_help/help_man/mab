\fBmab alpha beta\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBmab\fP macro is used to set a surface diffractometer
to a given angle of incidence \fBalpha\fP
and to position the detector at a given angle of
reflection \fBbeta\fP (in the plane of incidence) with respect to the surface.
It does not necessarily move the detector into the plane of incidence.
