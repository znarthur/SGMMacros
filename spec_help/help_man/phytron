.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The Phytron motor controllers come in a wide variety of models and
firmware versions.
Some firmware versions known to work with \fBspec\fP include the following:

\fBspec\fP supports GPIB and RS\-232C interfaces on the Phytron controllers.
Select the appropriate interface on the \fBDevice\fP screen of the configuration
editor along the following lines:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
MOTORS        DEVICE   ADDR  <>MODE  NUM                           <>TYPE

The corresponding entries in the \fBconfig\fP file would be:

\fBGP_IXE  =  gpib_address  number_of_motors\fP

.SH "Finding the Reference Position"

.sp
The Phytron\(aqs axis initialization command \fB"0"\fP, which
searches for the negative limit switch,
is sent to a specific motor when
the \fBchg_dial()\fP function is invoked with either
the \fB"home+"\fP or \fB"home\-"\fP arguments.
The free\-axis\-displacement commands,
\fB"L+"\fP and \fB"L\-"\fP, are sent with
the \fB"lim+"\fP and \fB"lim\-"\fP arguments,
respectively.
.sp
There is no fixed hardware signal for a home switch on the Phytron
controller, but there are twelve digital inputs available on the input
connector. There is also a command which will perform a relative
move at the base rate until one of the inputs goes high or low or
the magnitude of the move is reached. There are four parameters in
this command:  the direction of the move, the magnitude of the move,
the binary input number and the sense of the input switch. All four
parameters are set by entering a string for the \fBhome method\fP
(or \fB"home_method"\fP via \fBmotor_par()\fP)
optional motor parameter.
The \fBhome method\fP can be entered on the first
optional\-motor\-parameter screen.
(Get there by typing \fBm\fP once from the standard motor parameter screen.)
The string you enter will be sent to the motor when
the \fB"home"\fP argument is used with the
\fB"chg_dial()"\fP function.
The string is the actual command
sent to the Phytron, and is of the form
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBSmagvEnnD\fP
.RE
.sp
where \fBS\fP is a \fB+\fP or a \fB\-\fP for the
sign of the move, \fBmag\fP is the magnitude of the move
(maximum of 65535 steps), \fBnn\fP is the input number
(01 through 12) and \fBD\fP is the sense of the input where
0 means the motor stops if the input goes off and 1 means the motor
stops if the input goes on. For example,
.sp
.RS 4m
\fB+200vE071\fP
.RE
.sp
would command the motor to move no more than 200 steps in the plus
direction, or until input 7 goes ON.
.sp
For compatibility with older versions of \fBspec\fP,
\fBgeneric parameter 1\fP (or \fB"misc_par_1"\fP) can instead be
used to hold the home\-method string for the Phytron models.
.SH "Special Commands"
.rs
.sp
Some Phytron models apparently cannot keep up with
commands sent by the computer at full speed.
One can slow down the
communication between \fBspec\fP and the Phytron controllers with the following commands:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "rdelay" [,value])\fP
\- 
If \fBvalue\fP is given, sets the delay before reading a
response from the Phytron to \fBvalue\fP seconds, otherwise
returns the current value.  The default value is 0.015.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "wdelay" [,value])\fP
\- 
If \fBvalue\fP is given, sets the delay before sending a
command to the Phytron to \fBvalue\fP seconds, otherwise
returns the current value.  The default value is 0.015.
.RE
.sp
Only one copy of the \fBrdelay\fP and \fBwdelay\fP parameters is kept
for all the Phytron controllers. The motor mnemonic motor can be
associated with any of the Phytron controllers. The values for the
parameters are saved in the state file, so should only need to be reset
after starting fresh.
.sp
Command pass through is available using the following functions.
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "send", cmd)\fP
\- 
Sends the string \fBcmd\fP to the Phytron channel associated
with \fBmotor\fP.
.RE
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "read", cmd)\fP
\- 
Sends the string \fBcmd\fP to the Phytron channel associated
with \fBmotor\fP, as above, and returns a string containing
the response.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "usend", cmd)\fP
\- 
Sends the string \fBcmd\fP to the Phytron controller associated
with \fBmotor\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "uread", cmd)\fP
\- 
Sends the string \fBcmd\fP to the Phytron controller associated
with \fBmotor\fP, as above, and returns a string containing
the response.
.RE
.sp
For example,
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
0.FOURC> print motor_par(tth, "read", "P20R")
240000

0.FOURC>
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
results in the string \fB"\e002XP20R\e003\er\en"\fP being sent to
the controller. Command pass through should be used with caution to
avoid interfering with the built\-in programming commands \fBspec\fP sends
to the Phytron controllers.
.sp
The following commands are also available to help with debugging:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "chan_init")\fP
\- 
Sends the initialization strings to the specified channel.
The sames commands are sent when doing hardware configuration
on start up or on \fBreconfig\fP.
.RE
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "dump")\fP
\- 
Displays the values of Phytron parameters P01 through P10 and P12
through P17 for the channel associated with motor.
