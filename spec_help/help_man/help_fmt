.SH "SPECIAL NOTE FOR \fBspec\fP RELEASE 6"
.rs
.sp
The syntax described below is no longer used by the
standard \fBspec\fP help utility.
With \fBspec\fP release 6,
help files are now authored using
reStructuredText (reST) format.
For terminal display, the reST files are converted to an
\fInroff\fP format, then processed using \fIman\fP\-page type macros
for display.
.sp
Files residing in the
\fBSPECD\fP\fB/help\fP directory that use the following
directives will be processed using \fIgroff\fP (or \fInroff\fP)
with a compatible macro set.
The \fBspec\fP program itself no longers contains
built\-in code for formatting help files.
.SH "INTRODUCTION"
.rs
.sp
This document describes the formatting syntax and conventions used
with the \fBspec\fP and \fBC\-PLOT\fP help files.
The formatting syntax uses the conventions of the traditional
UNIX text formatters (\fBnroff\fP, \fBtroff\fP, \fBditroff\fP, etc.),
although only a small subset of the formatting directives are
supported by the \fBspec\fP and \fBC\-PLOT\fP built\-in formatting.
The supported directives are described below.
.sp
The distributions of \fBspec\fP and \fBC\-PLOT\fP include utilities
for preparing both PostScript and HTML (hyper text markup language)
versions of the help files using either the standard \fBditroff\fP or the GNU
\fBgroff\fP packages.
.SH "FORMATTING COMMANDS"
.rs
.sp
Input text that has a dot on the first line is a formatting command.
Unrecognized commands are ignored in \fBspec\fP and \fBC\-PLOT\fP.
.sp
The following commands are supported:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fB.\e"\fP
\- 
Begins a comment.  The rest of the text on the line is ignored.
.HP 5m
."
\fB.bp\fP
\- 
Begins a new page.
.HP 5m
."
\fB.BP\fP
\- 
Same as above.
.HP 5m
."
\fB.ne N\fP
\- 
Indicates \fBN\fP lines are needed on the current page.
If there isn\(aqt enough room on the current page, a new page is started.
.HP 5m
."
\fB.sp N\fP
\- 
spaces \fBN\fP lines.  Without an argument, one line is skipped.
The argument may contain a decimal point
and a unit indicator for the benefit of
\fBnroff\fP/\fBtroff\fP, although for \fBspec\fP
and \fBC\-PLOT\fP, only the integer part of the argument is used.
.HP 5m
."
\fB.ta N\fP
\- 
Start words every \fBN\fP letters, somewhat like using tabs.
.HP 5m
."
\fB.br\fP
\- 
Causes a line break.
The current line is finished and a new line is started.
.HP 5m
."
\fB.nf\fP
\- 
Switch to no\-fill mode.
Each newline in the input causes a newline in the output.
.HP 5m
."

Words are collected from the input until a full line of output is available.
.HP 5m
."
\fB.TH name category date SCCS_info\fP
\- 
Should be on the first line of a help file.
The arguments are used in the page header (and footer, when printed) and
are, respectively, the name of the help file, the category (such as
macro, function, reference, etc.), the date the file was last revised
and source\-code control information.
.HP 5m
."
\fB.SH\fP
\- 
Does a subhead.
There can\(aqt be more than six arguments, although you can use
double quotes to put more than one word in an argument.
Subheads are placed all the way to the left of the page.
.HP 5m
."

The optional argument \fBN\fP specifies the indent level.
This command will skip a line.
.HP 5m
."
\fB.PP\fP

The optional argument \fBF\fP indicates the font to use and may be
\fBR\fP, \fBI\fP, \fBC\fP, \fBB\fP or \fBO\fP.

The optional argument \fBN\fP is the number of lines needed.
If there is not enough room to print that many lines on the current page,
a new page will be started.
The optional argument \fBI\fP is the number of spaces
of extra indentation to add.
.HP 5m

.HP 5m
."
\fB.NE\fP
\- 
Only relevant for screen displays, this command indicates the screen
should not be erased before displaying the first page.
.HP 5m
."
\fB#\fP
\- 
Starts a comment if its the first character on a line.
The rest of the text on the line is ignored.
This comment notation is only for files
that will not be run off using \fBnroff\fP/\fBtroff\fP.

For non\-HTML formats, the text is copied verbatim in the indicated font.
.RE
.SH "FONT CONTROL"
.rs
.sp
The help files use the following fonts for the purposes indicated.
In the printed documentation, the New Century
Schoolbook typeface is used for the Roman, italic and bold fonts.
When used with \fBspec\fP and \fBC\-PLOT\fP, the directives to switch to bold,
italic or one of the Courier typefaces result in highlighted text
on a video terminal.
.sp
Roman (R) \- Used for normal text.
.sp
\fBItalic\fP (I) \- Used for file and path names, including system commands,
along with book titles, etc.
.sp
\fBBold\fP (B) \- Used for section heads.  Occasionally used for emphasis.
Sometimes used to display arguments to system commands.
.sp
\fBCourier\fP (C) \- Used to represent literal text that might be output by
the computer program or might be typed by a user at the keyboard.
.sp
\fBCourier Bold\fP (CB) \- Occasionally used to distinguish text
a user types from text output by the computer.
.sp
\fBCourier Oblique\fP (O) \- Used to represent variable computer text, such
as the argument to a function.
.sp
"Quoted Text" (Q) \- Not really a font, but used to place double quotes
around a bit of text.
.sp
All the fonts, except Roman, display as highlighted text on the video terminal.
.sp
The formatting commands:
.sp
.RS 4m
\fB.B .C .I .O\fP
.RE
.sp
put their arguments in the associated font.
If there are no arguments to the above commands,
the next line of input is put in that font.
.sp
The formatting commands:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
\&.RB  .BR  .IR  .CR  .OR  .CB
\&.RI  .BI  .IB  .CI  .OC
\&.RC       .IC  .CO
\&.RO
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
place the first argument in the first font, the second argument in
the second font and append an optional third argument in the regular text font,
except for \fB.CB\fP, which uses Courier Bold and Roman for the two fonts.
The space characters between the arguments are removed.  Use
double quotes to include space characters within arguments.
A space character is added after the last argument.
The formatting commands:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
\&.rb       .ir
\&.ri            .ci  .oc
\&.rc       .ic  .co
\&.ro
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
work as above, except a space characters is not appended
after the last argument.
.sp
The \fB@\fP symbol is used in the help file sources to represent
literal double quote characters, which
makes it easier to insert literal double quote characters into
formatting command arguments.  To enter a literal
\fB@\fP use both a backslash and the troff \fB.tr\fP directive, as in:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
\&.tr @@
a literal \e@ appears
\&.tr @"
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.SH "SPECIAL CHARACTER SEQUENCES"
.rs
.sp
The following special character sequences are recognized:
.sp
.RS 4m
.TS

\fB\ef\e*(#O\fP	Switch to font O
.TE
.RE
.SH "HINTS"
.rs
.sp
Since the \fB.if\fP command is not recognized by the \fBspec\fP and \fBC\-PLOT\fP
built\-in formatter,
use the command \fB.if t ...\fP to insert formatting directives
to be executed only when the help files are being printed with \fBtroff\fP.
