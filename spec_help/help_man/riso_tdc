.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The Risoe Time\-to\-Digital Converter (TDC) P2011a/P2012a
processes events from the Risoe 2D multiwire small angle neutron
scattering detector.  \fBspec\fP supports the TDC over a GPIB interface.
.sp
The controller is selected in the \fBconfig\fP file with the line
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBGP_RISOTDC = gpib_address @img_sel\fP
.RE
.sp
where
\fBsel\fP is the image\-device number used as the first argument in the
\fBimage_par()\fP and \fBimage_get()\fP functions below.
When running the configuration editor, switch to  the
MCA\- and CCD\-like device configuration
screen to select the Risoe TDC as a CCD\-like device.
.sp
The size of the 2D data array sent by the TDC is 128x128.
The native data type is unsigned long.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.rs
.sp
The \fBimage_par()\fP function controls the TDC behavior as follows:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "clear")\fP
\- 
Clears the TDC memory.
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "run")\fP
\- 
Start data collection.  Memory is not cleared.
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "halt")\fP
\- 
Halt data collection.
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "XYmode")\fP
\- 
Set 2D mode, 128x128 pixels.
This is the default mode.
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "Xmode")\fP
\- 
Set data collection to 1D mode along the horizontal direction.
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "Ymode")\fP
\- 
Set data collection to 1D mode along the vertical direction.
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_par(sel, "map", num)\fP
\- 
Set the map number as described in the TDC manual.
The default value for \fBnum\fP is zero,
which is appropriate for 2D data collection.
For 1D data collection, a value of 2 is recommended.
.HP 5m
."
\fBimage_get(sel, arr)\fP
\- 
Reads data into the array \fBarr\fP.
