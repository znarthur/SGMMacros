.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
\fBspec\fP supports energy\-selecting monochromators in three configurations.
The first configuration uses a single motor to control the monochromator tilt.
The second configuration uses three motors to control the tilt of two
crystals and the travel distance between them.
The third configuration takes into account a fourth motor to control
the offset between the two crystals.
(In the three\-motor configuration the offset is a fixed parameter.)
.sp
All of the monochromator support is contained in the macro source file
\fBmacros/energy.mac\fP, which is automatically installed
with the standard macro library.
When the macros are read, commands from the \fBenergy.mac\fP file check
whether particular motor mnemonics are present in the \fBconfig\fP file.
Motors with mnemonics \fBmonu\fP, \fBmond\fP, \fBmontrav\fP and
\fBmonoff\fP select the four\-motor configuration.
The mnemonics stand for the upstream, downstream, travel and offset
monochromator motors.
If there are only motors with mnemonics \fBmonu\fP, \fBmond\fP and
\fBmontrav\fP, the three\-motor configuration is selected.
Having just a motor with a mnemonic of either \fBmonu\fP or
\fBmono\fP selects the one\-motor configuration.

\fBsetmono [d\-spacing] [offset]\fP
\- 
Used to enter the monochromator d\-spacing.
If using a three\-motor monochromator, you can also enter
the offset between the two crystals.
With no arguments, the macro will prompt you to enter values.
If you enter a \fB0\fP for the d\-spacing in interactive mode,
you will then be prompted to enter the type of crystal
and its Miller indices.
The macro will then calculate the d\-spacing for you.
The macro knows about Silicon and Germanium crystals.
For other materials, you need to enter the crystal lattice parameter.
The distributed \fBsetmono\fP only allows you
to change the parameters if you have write permission for the file
\fBg_mo_d.mac\fP in \fBspec\fP\(aqs auxiliary file directory.
The current values of the parameters \fBg_mo_d\fP and \fBg_mo_s\fP (if used)
are stored in that file.
If you can\(aqt write the \fBg_mo_d.mac\fP file,
the file is read as a command file.
If you can write to the file,
the file will be updated with the new parameters.
.HP 5m
."
\fBgetE\fP
\- 
Displays the current energy calculated
from the monochromator motor position(s).
.HP 5m
."
\fBmoveE energy_in_KeV\fP
\- 
Moves the monochromator motor(s) to correspond to the energy value
given as an argument.
The macro writes the new energy to the data file using the
\fBcomment\fP macro.
.HP 5m
."
\fBsetE energy_in_KeV\fP
\- 
Changes the user offset of the monochromator motor(s) so that the
current motor position(s) correspond
to the energy value given as an argument.
No motors are moved.
The \fBset\fP macro, which comments a change of a motor\(aqs user offset
to the data file, is used within \fBsetE\fP.
(Additional motors that may be involved by way of the
\fBcalcM_local\fP macro will not be set by this macro.)
.HP 5m
."
\fBEscan start end intervals time [ fixQ ]\fP
\- 
Does an energy scan, starting at the energy given by
\fBstart\fP and ends at the energy given by \fBend\fP. The step size is
\fB(start\-end)/intervals\fP.
The number of data points collected will be \fBintervals+1\fP.
Count time is given by \fBtime\fP, which if positive,
specifies seconds and if negative, specifies monitor counts.
If the optional fifth argument is given as the literal characters
\fBfixQ\fP, the values of \fBH\fP, \fBK\fP and
\fBL\fP at the start of the scan are maintained at each point.

\fB_assign_mono\fP
\- 
Figures out which kind of monochromator is being used from motor mnemonics

.RE
.SH "NOTES"
.rs
.sp
To control access to the monochromator parameters, the \fBspec\fP
administrator can set the write permission and ownership of the
\fBg_mo_d.mac\fP file appropriately.
.sp
To have the monochromator parameters automatically read in by each
user running \fBspec\fP, put the line
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBqdofile(sprintf("%s/g_mo_d.mac",SPECD))\fP
.RE
.sp
in the \fBsite.mac\fP file in the auxiliary file directory.
(The \fBsite.mac\fP file is automatically read as a command file each
time a user starts \fBspec\fP.)
.sp
The business of storing the monochromator parameters in a file
will need to be changed if there is more than one version of \fBspec\fP
using monochromators running at the same time on the same computer.
