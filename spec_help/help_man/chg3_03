.SH "RELEASE 3.03.26"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.26 as of May 27, 1996.
.SH "Default Hardware Poll Interval Changed From 40 To 10 msec"
.sp
The hardware poll interval, used with non\-interrupt driven devices, has
been changed from 40 to 10 milliseconds.
The value can be changed using
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBspec_par("hdw_poll_interval", msec)\fP
.RE
.sp
where
\fBmsec\fP
is the poll interval in milliseconds.
The function
\fBspec_par("hdw_poll_interval")\fP
returns the current value.
Note that the actual interval may vary.
Most platforms have a resolution of only ten milliseconds in the
system clock, and different platforms round
\fBmsec\fP
up or down.
.SH "Improvements For the Microcontrole ITL09 Motor Controller"
.sp
A number of improvements have been made for the
Microcontrole ITL09 motor controller.
In particular,
the nonconsecutive unit/channel numbering feature of the
configuration editor is now supported for this controller.
.SH "Support For Newport Model MM2500 and MM4000 Controllers Added"
.sp
The Newport Model MM2500 and MM4000 motor controllers are now supported
by \fBspec\fP.
.SH "MMC32 Delay Is Now Configurable"
.sp
The sleep delay inserted after each command sent to the NSLS MMC32
motor controller is now user configurable.
Use
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmotor_par(mne, "delay",  msec)\fP
.RE
.sp
where
\fBmne\fP
is the mnemonic of any motor controlled by the MMC32 and
\fBmsec\fP
is the delay time in milliseconds.
The delay affects all motors controlled by the MMC32.
The default value is 100 msec.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.25"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.25 as of May 7, 1996.
.SH "The \fBtwoc\fP Code Has Been Revised"
.sp
The geometry code and macros for the two\-circle diffractometer
have been rewritten to use an orientation matrix and to allow
least squares refinement of the lattice parameters.
The
\fBsetlat\fP
and
\fBsetrlat\fP
macros are used to set the direct or reciprocal lattice parameters.
The
\fBor0\fP
and
\fBsetor0\fP
macros are used to set the orientation reflection.
The
\fBreflex_beg\fP,
\fBreflex_end\fP
and
\fBreflex\fP
macros are used to save reflections used to refine the lattice parameters,
in the same way as described in the
\fBFour\-Circle Reference\fP.
The
\fBALPHA\fP
and
\fBBETA\fP
parameters have been eliminated.
Note,
if you desire, the previous version of
\fBtwoc\fP
can be installed by selecting
\fBtwoc_old\fP
from the installation menu.
Be sure to start fresh the first time running the new
version of
\fBtwoc\fP.
.SH "New \fB.Xdefaults\fP Option For Size Of Plot Points"
.sp
You can
now choose among several pixel patterns for drawing the
smallest points on the \fBspec\fP X11 high\-resolution plots.
The selection is made in the
\fB.Xdefaults\fP
resource file.
See the explanation of the
\fBDotSize\fP
resource in the
\fI\%x11\fP help file for details.
.SH "No CAMAC Z Issued On Startup With DSP 6001 In Driverless Mode"
.sp
By user request,
\fBspec\fP no longer issues the CAMAC Z crate initialization command
on startup when using the DSP 6001/2 CAMAC crate controller in
driverless mode.
(With the CSS driver, whether the automatic Z is issued is
determined by a driver\-installation option.)
The function
\fBca_cntl("Z")\fP
can always be issued at the \fBspec\fP prompt to initialize the crate,
if necessary.
.SH "Small Change In \fBcount_em\fP Macro"
.sp
The
\fBCOUNT_TIME\fP
variable is now set to the current count time before
(instead of after)
the call of the
\fBuser_precount\fP
macro in the
\fBcount_em\fP
macro that is called by all the standard counting macros.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.24"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.24 as of April 1, 1996.
.SH "Improvements For Newport MM2000 and MM3000 Motor Controllers"
.sp
A number of improvements have been made for the
Newport (formerly Klinger) MM2000 motor controller.
The nonconsecutive unit/channel numbering feature of the
configuration editor is supported for this controller.
Also, serial\-interface daisy\-chaining is now supported.
The Newport MM3000 model has firmware compatible with the MM2000,
so is also now supported by \fBspec\fP.
.SH "Improvements For Huber SMC 9000 Motor Controller"
.sp
The nonconsecutive unit/channel numbering feature of the
configuration editor is now supported for the Huber SMC 9000 motor controller.
\fBspec\fP now allows more than one of these controllers to be configured.
In addition, the error checking has been improved, although the nature of
the controller makes the potential for recovery after a communications
error unlikely.
In addition,
a command pass through capability is now available
using
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmotor_par(mne, "send",  cmd)\fP
.RE
.sp
to send the
command
\fBcmd\fP
to the controller
and
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmotor_par(mne, "read",  cmd)\fP
.RE
.sp
to send the command
\fBcmd\fP
and return as a string an expected reply.
The motor mnemonic argument
\fBmne\fP
only serves to select which controller to use.
Unlike the implementation for other controllers,
the motor number must be explicitly included in the user message for
the Huber SMC 9000.
For example,
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmotor_par(tth, "send", "BEEPOFF")\fP
.RE
.sp
results in the string
\fB"BEEPOFF;\er\en"\fP
being sent to the controller associated with the
\fBtth\fP
motor.
.SH "Pseudomotor \fBchg_dial()\fP Bug Fixed"
.sp
A bug, where the
\fBchg_dial()\fP
function (as used by the
\fBset_dial\fP
macro), didn\(aqt work properly for pseudomotors or any motor with
\fBNONE\fP
as controller in
the
\fBconfig\fP
file, has been fixed.
.SH "Bug Fix For Alternate Command\-Line History"
.sp
A bug, where the number of commands saved in the run\-time
history list
was not limited when using
the optional, alternate command\-line history library,
has been fixed.
The run\-time history is now limited to 1,000 commands, just as is
the history saved in the state file.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.23"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.23 as of March 13, 1996.
.SH "New Site\-Dependent \fBInstall\fP Parameters"
.sp
The \fBspec\fP
\fBInstall\fP
program now prompts for additional parameters for
site\-dependent compiler flags,
site\-dependent object modules and site\-dependent libraries.
.SH "Experimental User\-Configurable Pseudomotor Code"
.sp
Files dealing with an experimental, user\-configurable, compile\-time
pseudomotor capability are included in this distribution.
Consult CSS before attempting to use.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.22 \- Several Portability Fixes"
.rs
.sp
March 5, 1996:  Several minor changes have been made for portability
considerations.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.21 \- Bug In \fBedconf\fP Wizard\-Mode Fixed"
.rs
.sp
February 21, 1996:  A bug, where the optional motor parameters
could not be read in
on wizard\-mode protected motors, has been fixed.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.20"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.20 as of February 13, 1996.
.SH "Code For CAMAC Kinetic Systems 3640 Counter/Timer Overhauled"
.sp
Problems with the software handling of the custom
hardware gating on the Kinetic Systems 3640 CAMAC
counter/timer, as used at CHESS (and elsewhere), have been fixed.
.SH "New \fBmotor_par()\fP Option for ESRF Maxe Motor Device Server"
.sp
The new
\fBmotor_par()\fP
option,
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmotor_par(mne, "get_pars")\fP
.RE
.sp
reads the current base rate, acceleration and slew rate parameters from
the ESRF Maxe device server and updates the values that will be returned
by
\fBmotor_par()\fP
with the
\fB"base_rate"\fP,
\fB"acceleration"\fP
and
\fB"velocity"\fP
arguments.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.19"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.19 as of February 1, 1996.
.SH "Improvements To the \fBchelp\fP Stand\-Alone Help Viewer"
.sp
The stand\-alone \fBspec\fP help file viewer
\fBchelp\fP
will now use the same rules
as \fBspec\fP for selecting the auxiliary file directory.
A
.BI \-D " directory"
option will override a
\fBSPECD\fP
environment variable,
and the environment variable will override the compiled\-in default.
Also,
\fBchelp\fP
has been fixed to no longer change tty terminal modes if the
standard output is not a tty, such as when the output of
\fBchelp\fP
is piped through a standard file browser such as
\fBmore\fP
or
\fBless\fP.
.SH "Wizard\-Mode \fBedconf\fP Bug Fixed"
.sp
A bug, whereby optional motor parameters (from the
\fBedconf\fP
\fBm\fP
screens) would not be read in by
\fBedconf\fP
for motors with
wizard\-level protection, has been fixed.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.18"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.18 as of January 19, 1996.
.SH "\fBDISPLAY\fP Can Now Be Assigned and Exported"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now includes
\fBDISPLAY\fP
as one of its built\-in variables.
The environment variable
\fBDISPLAY\fP
is used by X Window clients to figure out on which host to run.
On startup, \fBspec\fP will set the value of
\fBDISPLAY\fP
from the environment variable.
If
\fBDISPLAY\fP
is not set in the environment, the value saved in the user\(aqs state file
will be used.
The value of
\fBDISPLAY\fP
can be changed while running \fBspec\fP, and the current value will be
exported to new
\fBx11filt\fP
processes as they are spawned.
For example,
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
DISPLAY="host1:0"; plot_cntl("filter1,open")
DISPLAY="host2:0"; plot_cntl("filter2,open")
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
will create plot windows on two different hosts.
.SH "Argument Restrictions For \fBchg_dial()\fP, \fBgpib_get()\fP and \fBser_get\fP Eased"
.sp
Previously, when string values were needed for the second argument of the
\fBchg_dial()\fP,
\fBgpib_get()\fP
or
\fBser_get()\fP
functions,
the argument had to be in the form of literal string constant.
Now, a string\-valued variable can be used.
To call
\fBgpib_get()\fP
or
\fBser_get()\fP
with an end\-of\-string delimiter that starts with a number, use a
string constant.
.SH "Keithley\-Metrabyte CTM\-10 Fully Supported"
.sp
The second AMD Am9513 counter chip on the
Keithley\-Metrabyte CTM\-10 PC timer/counter board can now be accessed from
\fBspec\fP.
In the configuration file, select the
\fBMetrabyte or Labmaster PC Board\fP
device as for the CTM\-05 board, but configure it for five channels.
With the CTM\-10, two additional 32\-bit scaler channels are available.
In addition to the jumpers need for the CTM\-05 board, you must also
connect output 1 of the first chip to gates
2 and 4 of the second chip.
The additional scaler channels should be
connected to the source 3 and source 5 inputs
of the second chip.
.SH "Initialization Problem with Nucleus PCA\-3 Fixed"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now includes a longer delay (1 second) after resetting the
Nucleus PCA\-3 board during hardware initialization to give the board
time to become responsive to commands issued from \fBspec\fP.
.SH "Either Compumotor 4000 Serial Port Can Now Be Used"
.sp
The Compumotor 4000 motor controller has two serial ports.
Previously, port 1 had to be used with \fBspec\fP.
Now either port can be used.
As this motor controller is so little used, the change in the
configuration file to select among the two ports is not backwards
compatible.
.SH "EPICS Motor Control Improvements"
.sp
A number of changes have been made in the support for the EPICS motor
driver as used at APS.
The
\fBDMOV\fP
record is now monitored for motor status, rather than
\fBMOVN\fP.
The automatic backlash capabilities in the driver are now used.
\fBspec\fP now also loads the values for base rate and backlash steps from
\fBspec\fP\(aqs configuration file into the EPICS data base, along with the
other motor parameters such as steady\-state speed and acceleration.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.17"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.17 as of January 9, 1996.
.SH "New Startup Option To Set \fBspec_par()\fP Parameters"
.sp
The parameters available through the
\fBspec_par()\fP
function can now also be set on the command line when \fBspec\fP is invoked
using a \fB\-o par=value\fP syntax.
For example,
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
fourc \-o auto_file_close=2 \-o check_file_names=no
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
turns on the option to close idle output files after two hours
and turns off the option to check output file names for nonstandard
and unprintable characters.
In the future,
\fBspec_par()\fP\-type
options may
may be introduced that must be set on the command line as they relate
to initialization actions taken before the first prompt is issued.
.SH "Bug In SunOS 4.x Support Of KS\-3929 SCSI\-CAMAC Code Fixed"
.sp
A bug, introduced in the Sun platform support for the Kinetic
Systems 3929 SCSI\-CAMAC controller in \fBspec\fP release 2.02.01
(when the HP platform support was added),
which sometimes made \fBspec\fP unusable with that module on the Sun platform
has been fixed.
Also, crate inhibit is now automatically cleared when \fBspec\fP initializes
the 3929 on the Sun platforms (as \fBspec\fP already does for the 3929 on the
HP platform).
.SH "Bug In Setting CAMAC Inhibit Fixed"
.sp
A bug, where trying to set CAMAC crate inhibit using the command
\fBca_cntl("inhibit", 1)\fP,
was both ineffective and also led to segmentation violations on some
platforms, has been fixed.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.16 \- PCA\-II Driver For \fBlinux\fP Available"
.rs
.sp
December 17, 1995:  \fBspec\fP now supports operation of the Nucleus PCA\-II
MCA card in live\-time mode on
\fBlinux\fP
systems with a CSS\-provided loadable\-module driver.
The driver is installed with the
\fBinstall_pca\fP
script in the
\fBdrivers\fP
subdirectory of the \fBspec\fP distribution.
The interrupt number and base address, as set by the dip switches on
the PCA\-II board, should be specified when installing the driver if they
differ from the defaults.
See the
\fBREADME\fP
file in the
\fBdrivers\fP
directory for further information on installing the driver.
See the
\fI\%pca\fP help file for important information on the need to replace
a resistor on the PCA\-II board for interrupts to work with certain
PC motherboards.
(Note, if you are using the CSS PCA driver on System V/386\-type
UNIX platforms, you must install the new version of the driver for use with
this and subsequent \fBspec\fP releases due to a small, but incompatible
change made in the driver to accommodate
\fBlinux\fP.)
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.15"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.15 as of November 28, 1995.
.SH "New Auto\-Close Option For \fBspec\fP Output Files"
.sp
A new option is available to automatically close output files
that haven\(aqt been accessed for some interval of time.
Calling
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBspec_par("auto_file_close", hours)\fP
.RE
.sp
sets the interval to
\fBhours\fP,
which can have a non\-integral value.
When the auto\-close option is enabled,
each time an
\fBon()\fP,
\fBoff()\fP,
\fBopen()\fP,
\fBclose()\fP
or
\fBfprintf()\fP
function is called,
\fBspec\fP will check its list of opened output files.
Any files which
have not been written to for the length of time given by
\fBhours\fP
will be closed.
Enabling this option can help prevent errors
when your macros or commands
do not close files when appropriate, resulting
in \fBspec\fP running out of resources to open additional files.
As files are opened automatically when sent output,
auto\-close mode operates transparently for the most part.
However, if you change to a different working
directory between the time the file is first
opened and subsequently automatically closed,
and if the file is not opened by an
absolute path name, the next time you refer to the file,
\fBspec\fP will reopen it using a relative path based on the current directory.
Calling
\fBspec_par("auto_file_close", 0)\fP
disables the mode.
By default, the mode is initially disabled.
.SH "New \fBplot_cntl()\fP Option To Set X11 Window Geometry"
.sp
The option
\fBplot_cntl("geometry=string")\fP,
is now available.
With the
\fBx11\fP
high\-resolution plot windows only,
this function sets the size and position of the window.
The format of the geometry string is the same as expected by
standard X windows applications, as in
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBplot_cntl("geometry=512x380\-0+10")\fP
.RE
.sp
As with the conventional syntax, not all parts of the geometry string
are required.
.SH "New \fBshowscans\fP Options"
.sp
The
\fBshowscans\fP
utility, which makes twelve mini\-plots per page of a \fBspec\fP data file
using \fBC\-PLOT\fP, has two new options.
The new
\fB\-w\fP
option will cause \fBC\-PLOT\fP to wait for a
\fB<return>\fP
from the keyboard after each page is displayed.
(This option should not be used when sending the output to a printer.)
The new
\fB\-x\fP
option is a shorthand for the options
\fB\-zi "x11 \-rotate" \-w\fP,
which are the best options to use to interactively view
\fBshowscans\fP
results on an X windows display.
.SH "Improved Debugging For ESRF Device Servers"
.sp
The debugging messages printed for all \fBspec\fP calls of the
\fBdev_putget()\fP
routine, used to access the ESRF device servers,
now show the command name and the values of the
input and output
arguments in a consistent format.
These messages are displayed when hardware debugging
is enabled by including bit 0x40 (64)
in the value assigned to the built\-in
variable
\fBDEBUG\fP.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.14"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.14 as of November 16, 1995.
.SH "Easier\-To\-Use Choice Menus For Configuration Editor"
.sp
The configuration editor
\fBedconf\fP
now displays all the choices for such things as motor\-controller type and
serial\-device baud rates in a menu box.
The up and down or <> keys can be used to select among the choice
items.
.SH "New Invocation Options For Configuration Editor"
.sp
The configuration editor
\fBedconf\fP
takes two new options.
The
\fB\-D specdir\fP
option can be used to specify the \fBspec\fP auxiliary file directory.
The
\fB\-g geo\fP
option can be used to specify the geometry to be edited if the
multiple geometry feature (selected using the
\fBGEO#\fP
keywords in the
\fBconfig\fP
file) is enabled.
For example,
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
edconf \-D /usr/local/lib/spec.d \-g fourc spec
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
will edit the configuration file in the directory
\fB/usr/local/lib/spec.d/spec\fP,
and while in the configuration editor, the
\fBG\fP
command will toggle between displaying all motors and only those
associated with the
\fBfourc\fP
geometry group.
.SH "New \fB\-g geo\fP Flag"
.sp
\fBspec\fP can now be invoked with a
\fB\-g geo\fP
flag to force loading of macro files and activation of geometry calculations
for a particular geometry such as
\fBfourc\fP,
\fBsurf\fP
or
\fBkappa\fP
while using the configuration files taken from the name by which \fBspec\fP is
invoked.
For example,
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
spec \-g fourc
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
will use the configuration files from the
\fBSPECD/spec\fP
directory but will operate in four\-circle mode.
.SH "Alarms Blocked During Critical Code When Using Software Timer"
.sp
The
\fBSIGALRM\fP
signal, used by the software timer in \fBspec\fP,
is now blocked during critical code, such as during the RPC
calls used by the ESRF device server libraries, to prevent those
calls from being interrupted and generating error returns.
.SH "Minor Bug Relating to Text Output Fixed"
.sp
A bug in the implementation of the unlimited length
output strings introduced in release 3.03.10 has been fixed.
A manifestation of the bug was that when \fBspec\fP debugging was turned on and
used with a debugging log file, some messages generated by the
\fBprint\fP
command would not appear on the screen.
.SH "Bug In Data\-Pipe Installation Fixed"
.sp
An error in a
\fBMakefile\fP
in release 3.03.11
that generated an error message during \fBspec\fP installation when copying the
\fBdpmake\fP
utility has been fixed.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.13"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.13 as of October 19, 1995.
.SH "More Significant Digits For Motors In Data File"
.sp
The
\fB_ascan\fP,
\fBmesh\fP
and
\fBEscan\fP
standard macros have been changed to write up to eight significant
digits of the positions of the scanned motors to the data file.
The
\fB_head\fP
macro has also been changed to write up to eight significant digits
of the positions of all the motors in the standard scan header.
Previously, the maximum number of significant digits was six.
However, when \fBspec\fP calculates motor positions, it rounds the
calculated value to the motor step size.
Thus for most motors, there will be no visible change in the data files.
.SH "Support For Bit 3 Model 403 ISA\-To\-VME Controller On \fBlinux\fP"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now has direct support for VME devices using the Bit 3 Model 403
ISA bus to VME bus adapter.
Currently, this support is only available under
\fBlinux\fP.
Support on the HP 700 platforms with E/ISA bus will be added shortly.
As for VME devices,
\fBspec\fP currently supports the Mizar 8310 VME counting module
and the Oregon Micro Systems VME8 motor controller module.
Support for the Joerger Model VSC8 8\-channel scaler and the
Highland V540 micro\-stepping controller will be added shortly.
.SH "Linux I/O Port Access Checks For CSS Kernel Patch"
.sp
CSS provides a kernel patch for
\fBlinux\fP
that allows non\-root users access to I/O ports for hardware control.
Previously, if \fBspec\fP was run without the patch by a non\-root user,
\fBspec\fP would die from a segmentation violation at the first attempt at
accessing an I/O port.
Now, \fBspec\fP will print a message that the I/O ports are unavailable and
suggest the kernel patch be installed.
.SH "Support For Simultaneous HP and IOtech SICL GPIB"
.sp
The CSS\-modified IOtech SICL GPIB library introduced in \fBspec\fP release
3.03.01 is now available and supported in \fBspec\fP in a version with
with SICL function names that occupy a different name space from the
standard SICL library.
This changes allows, for example,
both an HP SICL library and the CSS\-modified
library to be linked into the same \fBspec\fP executable.
The disjoint name\-space version is selected in the
.i config
file with the keyword
\fBPC_IOTSICL_H\fP
(\fBPC_IOTSICL_H_L\fP
for the
\fBshared\fP
version).
From the configuration editor, select the
\fB"IOtech SCSI GPIB (ESRFized)"\fP
GPIB device.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.12"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.12 as of October 10, 1995.
.SH "\fBGTERM\fP Defaults To \fB\(dqx11\(dq\fP"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now sets the
\fBGTERM\fP
environment variable to
\fB"x11"\fP
by default if the variable is unset in the environment.
.SH "New Clean\-and\-Fresh Flag \fB\-F\fP"
.sp
A new
\fB\-F\fP
command line argument
not only starts \fBspec\fP fresh (as with the
\fB\-f\fP
flag) but also disables the reading of all startup macro files.
This flag can be of use to front\-end programs that want to
ensure which macros are defined by explicitly
specifying macro files to be read.
.SH "\fBconfig\fP\-File Motor Flags Saved In Hex"
.sp
The flags column for motors in the hardware
\fBconfig\fP
file is now saved in hexadecimal in order to make it easier to
interrupt geometry assignments in linked geometry configurations
when viewing the
\fBconfig\fP
file directly.
.SH "Klinger Motion\-Master Doesn\(aqt \fBsync\fP Motors Before Move"
.sp
\fBspec\fP no longer performs
automatic synchronization of hardware registers
and software positions before each move for motors controlled by the
Klinger Motion Master 2000.
This change apparently solves some problems reported by users.
.SH "Support For HP E2050 LAN/HP\-IB Gateway"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now recognizes the HP E2050 LAN/HP\-IB Gateway device.
The
\fBconfig\fP
file entry for the device name, which is used as
the argument to the
\fBSICL\fP
\fBiopen()\fP
subroutine, must have the format
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBlan[hostname]:interface\fP
.RE
.sp
where
\fBlan\fP
is the symbolic name for the device set in the
\fB/usr/pil/etc/hwconfig.hw\fP
file,
\fBhostname\fP
is the host name or IP address of the gateway
and
\fBinterface\fP
is
\fBhost\-name\fP
parameter in the gateway on\-board configuration (set via telnet to the
gateway).
.SH "Support For Bi Ra 5302 64\-Channel ADC as Counters"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports the Bi Ra Model 5302 ADC CAMAC module.
This module allows up to 64 analog inputs.
\fBspec\fP treats each channel as a counter, so each channel
should be configured on the configuration editor
scaler screen.
The value entered for the scale factor is interpreted as the
channel gain.
The ADC conversions are performed on the
\fBgetcounts\fP
command.
.SH "Bug Fixed in \fBdata_pipe()\fP Overhead Code"
.sp
A bug in the
\fBdata_pipe.o\fP
overhead function where the user\-callable function
\fBget_input_data()\fP
transferred the number of data points, rather than the number of points
times the number of elements for double\-sized \fBspec\fP data,
has been fixed.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.11 \- \fBdata_pipe()\fP Beta Release"
.rs
.sp
August 7, 1995:  The
\fBdata_pipe()\fP
facility is now in beta release.
This facility allows integration of external programs with \fBspec\fP,
somewhat along the lines of
\fBC\-PLOT\fP user functions.
See the
\fI\%data_pipe\fP help file for detailed information.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.10"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.10 as of July 29, 1995.
.SH "Unlimited Length For Input Strings"
.sp
Previously, string constants in \fBspec\fP were limited to 8,192 bytes.
That limit has been removed.
\fBspec\fP now allocates memory for strings as needed.
.SH "Unlimited Length Strings For \fBprintf()\fP"
.sp
Previously, the length of the result of a
\fBprintf()\fP,
\fBfprintf()\fP
or
\fBsprintf()\fP
was limited to 8,192 bytes.
That limit has been removed.
.SH "Unlimited Length Macros"
.sp
Previously, the length of macro definitions was limited to
8,064 bytes.
Macros may now be as long as one desires.
.SH "Input Push\-Back Space Increased"
.sp
The size of the input push\-back space has been doubled from
65,536 to 131,072 bytes.
The input push\-back space holds macro expansion text, so does
effectively limit the maximum length of a macro.
.SH "More Format Specifiers Recognized By \fBprintf()\fP"
.sp
The
\fBprintf()\fP
function now recognizes the
\fB%X\fP,
\fB%E\fP,
\fB%G\fP,
\fB%i\fP,
\fB%b\fP
and
\fB%p\fP
format specifiers
if they are recognized by the underlying C library version
of
\fBprintf()\fP.
.SH "Better Checking For \fBport_getw()\fP and \fBport_putw()\fP"
.sp
Previously, the
16\-bit PC I/O port access functions
\fBport_putw()\fP
and
\fBport_getw()\fP
did not check if the high\-byte port was included in the
\fBconfig\fP
file I/O port configuration.
In the configuration file, the number of consecutive addresses to
be enabled is in terms of 8\-bit addresses.
If the high\-byte port was not configured,
\fBspec\fP
would not have enabled access to the high\-byte port, and a
\fBport_getw()\fP
or
\fBport_putw()\fP
call
would result in \fBspec\fP terminating
with a segmentation violation.
\fBspec\fP now prints an error message and resets to command level if
access is attempted without proper configuration.
.SH "X11 Geometry Parsing Fixed"
.sp
A bug, where the X11 high\-resolution graphics filter
didn\(aqt treat negative values for the
\fBx\fP
and
\fBy\fP
position in the geometry string correctly, has been fixed.
A negative
value for
\fBx\fP
or
\fBy\fP,
including the value \-0, now specifies the position of the
right side of the X11 window relative to right side of the root
window, as is the usual convention.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.09"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.09 as of July  8, 1995.
.SH "More Simultaneous High\-Resolution Plots"
.sp
The number of allowed simultaneous
high\-resolution plot\-filter processes has been increased from two to five.
The functions
\fBplot_cntl("filter1")\fP
through
\fBplot_cntl("filter5")\fP
select the active filter.
.SH "New \fBplot_cntl()\fP Option To Set X11 Window Title"
.sp
The option
\fBplot_cntl("title=string")\fP,
is now available.
With the
\fBx11\fP
high\-resolution plot windows, the title given by
\fBstring\fP
is used in the
\fBXSetWindowProperties()\fP
call to set the window and icon labels.
On most X11 window managers, that means the title will
appear in the window\(aqs title bar.
.SH "EPICS Support On Linux Platforms Now Available"
.sp
\fBspec\fP is now working with EPICS (Release 3.12.13Beta) on
\fBlinux\fP
platforms.
When installing \fBspec\fP, select the
\fBepics_linux\fP
target.
.SH "Install Script Now Prompts For EPICS or ESRF Directories"
.sp
When installing \fBspec\fP on platforms that use the ESRF device
servers or the EPICS channel access libraries, the installation
script will now prompt for the directory that contains the
appropriate libraries.
Previously, the installation
\fB"makefile"\fP
used the names
\fB./dserver\fP
for the ESRF platforms
and
\fB./epics\fP
for the EPICS platforms, and
the local \fBspec\fP administrator was responsible for making those
names symbolic links to the correct directories.
.SH "Obscure Macro Bug Fixed"
.sp
A fairly old bug that caused the wrong definition
to be returned for the first macro
defined after starting fresh has been fixed.
The bug was most often manifested by the repeated message
\fBcleanup:  undefined\fP
appearing
when starting fresh when there was an error in the startup macro files.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.08 \- Fixes For SGI Platforms"
.rs
.sp
June 28, 1995: This release includes fixes to restore \fBspec\fP source
code portability to Silicon Graphics platforms.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.07 \- Kappa Geometry Improvements"
.rs
.sp
June 27, 1995: \fBspec\fP now supports
a vertical configuration of the
\fBkappa\fP
diffractometer.
The new
\fBsetvmode\fP
macro (from
the
\fBkappa.src\fP
macro file)
can be used to enable the vertical configuration features in the
\fBgeo_kappa.c\fP
source file.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.06"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.06 as of June 18, 1995.
.SH "Support For Heidenhain Encoders on MCU\-2"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports the
MCU\-2 motor controllers that have been specially modified to read
Heidenhain absolute encoders.
Select the
\fBMCU_H\fP
motor controller type on the motor screen of the configuration
editor and enter a value for the
\fB"encoder steps per deg/mm"\fP
parameter on the motor parameter screen when using that
hardware combination.
.SH "Bug In PCA\-3/Multiport Code Fixed"
.sp
A recently introduced bug (12/94) in the code
for the Nucleus PCA\-3 and Multiport devices
that prevented
the
\fBoffset\fP
parameter to be set to zero using
\fBmotor_par()\fP
has been fixed.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.05"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.05 as of June 11, 1995.
.SH "New \fBVERSION\fP Built\-in Variable"
.sp
A new read\-only built\-in variable
\fBVERSION\fP
contains the current \fBspec\fP version number.
.SH "Allow Multiple CAMAC QS\-450 Quad Scalers"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now allows more than one CAMAC DSP QS\-450 Quad Scalers
to be used at the same time.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.04"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.04 as of May 30, 1995.
.SH "Hardware Poll Interval Is Now Adjustable"
.sp
When the
\fBwait()\fP
function is called to
wait for polled motors, timers or other acquisition devices to finish,
\fBspec\fP sleeps for a small interval between each check of the hardware.
Previously, that interval was built into the code and set
(in recent releases)
to 40 msec.
That sleep time can now be changed using the new
\fB"hdw_poll_interval"\fP
parameter to the
\fBspec_par()\fP
function.
The units of the parameter are milliseconds.
The default value is 40 msec.
A value of zero is allowed, though
not recommended if the computer is being used for
anything else.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.03"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.03 as of May 28, 1995.
.SH "New \fBOmega\fP\-Type Four\-Circle Diffractometer"
.sp
The four\-circle geometry code and macros have been modified to
work with an
\fBomega\fP\-type
four\-circle diffractometer.
With this diffractometer, the
\fBtheta\fP
and
\fBtwo\-theta\fP
circles are mechanically coupled, such that the when the
\fBtwo\-theta\fP
circle is moved, the
\fBtheta\fP
circle moves half the distance.
The
\fBtheta\fP
circle can also be moved independently of
\fBtwo\-theta\fP.
This configuration corresponds to replacing the independent
\fBtheta\fP
motion with an
\fBomega\fP  = \fBtheta\fP  \- \fBtwo\-theta\fP/2
motion.
If there is a motor with the mnemonic
\fBth\fP
in the
\fBconfig\fP
file, \fBspec\fP assumes a standard four\-circle diffractometer.
If there is no
\fBth\fP
motor, but if there is a motor configured with the mnemonic
\fBom\fP,
\fBspec\fP assumes the
\fBomega\fP\-type
configuration.
The
\fBfourc.src\fP
macro file should be reread after changing the configuration.
One can start fresh or type
\fBnewmac\fP
to do that.
.SH "RELEASE 3.03.01"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.03.01 as of May 24, 1995.
.SH "New Option To Change Step Size With \fBmotor_par()\fP"
.sp
For the rare circumstances where it may be necessary, \fBspec\fP
now allows the motor step\-size parameter to be changed using
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmotor_par(mne, "step_size",  value)\fP
.RE
.sp
Since such changes should not be undertaken lightly, \fBspec\fP requires
they be explicitly enabled using
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBspec_par("modify_step_size", 1)\fP
.RE
.sp
Rereading the
\fBconfig\fP
file resets the step size parameter to the value in the
\fBconfig\fP
file.
.SH "No\-Echo Option With \fB\-p\fP"
.sp
If the file descriptor argument to \fBspec\fP\(aqs
\fB\-p\fP
startup option is zero, \fBspec\fP will not echo text received from
that file descriptor to the standard output, as was the case previously.
(The
\fB\-p\fP
option is used by GUI\-type programs that invoke \fBspec\fP as child process.)
.SH "New Continued\-Lines Option With \fBdata_dump()\fP"
.sp
The optional
argument
\fBfmt1\fP
to the
\fBdata_dump()\fP
function, which has
the form
\fB"%#"\fP,
and specifies how many data points (specified by the number
\fB#\fP)
are to be printed on each line, has a new option.
If the number
\fB#\fP
is followed by the letter
\fBC\fP,
a backslash is added to each continued line, appropriate for saving
MCA data in manageable length lines.
New versions (since May 1, 1995) of the \fBC\-PLOT\fP
\fBscans.4\fP
user function interpret the continued lines correctly for MCA data.
.SH "Improvements To \fBscans.4\fP"
.sp
The version of the
\fBscans.4\fP
\fBC\-PLOT\fP user function distributed in the \fBspec\fP
\fBaux\fP
directory has new features.
In particular, there is no longer a compiled\-in limit for the
number of points that can be read as raw data or the number of scans
that can be contained in one data file.
Also, the data file syntax recognized by
\fBscans.4\fP
has been expanded.
Directives of more than one letter that begin with
\fB#@\fP
are now recognized.
New directives for reading MCA\-type data have been added.
See the \fBspec\fP
\fI\%scans\fP help file for more information.
.SH "New \fBmotor_par()\fP Options for OMS Controllers"
.sp
A command pass through capability is now available for all versions of
the OMS motor
controller using
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmotor_par(mne, "send",  cmd)\fP
.RE
.sp
to send the
command
\fBcmd\fP
to the controller
and
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmotor_par(mne, "read",  cmd)\fP
.RE
.sp
to send the command
\fBcmd\fP
and return as a string an expected reply.
For example,
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
print motor_par(tth, "read", "RP")
240000
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
results in the string
\fB"AX RP\en"\fP
being sent to the controller.
.SH "Bug With the Klinger MotionMaster 2000 Fixed"
.sp
\fBspec\fP\(aqs code to support the Klinger MotionMaster 2000 motor controller
was developed on units that did not have all four motor modules
installed.
It turns out that with all modules installed on the ISA bus
version, \fBspec\fP must pause
about half a second after
sending the emergency stop character
\fB#\fP
(which it sends when initializing the board)
before the board is able to communicate again.
Such a pause
is now part of the code.
.SH "New \fBmotor_par()\fP Option for ACS MCU\-2"
.sp
On ACS MCU\-2 motor controllers equipped with the option to
read Heidenhain absolute encoders, the function
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmotor_par(mne, "encoder_position")\fP
.RE
.sp
will return the current encoder position.
.SH "CSS\-Modified Library Available For IOtech SCSI488/H"
.sp
CSS now provides an alternative
\fBlibsicl.a\fP
for use with the IOtech SCSI488/H SCSI\-to\-GPIB module on the HP 700
platform.
This version doesn\(aqt require a daemon process, as does the IOtech
version.
Contact CSS to obtain this version of the library.
.SH "CAMAC Crate Sharing Available With KS 3929 on HP 700"
.sp
When using the Kinetic Systems 3929 SCSI\-to\-CAMAC module on the HP 700
platform with the CSS\-provided software interface, CSS now allows more
than one version of \fBspec\fP to have access to the crate at a time.
.SH "Standalone Library For KS 3929 on HP 700"
.sp
CSS has created
a subroutine library for use with local programs that require access to
the Kinetic Systems 3929 SCSI\-to\-CAMAC module on the HP 700.
This library allows simultaneous access to the CAMAC crate by \fBspec\fP
and the local programs.
Contact CSS to obtain the library.
