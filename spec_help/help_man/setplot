The
\fBsetplot\fP macro asks the following questions:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
   1) Do real\-time plots during scans (YES)?
   2) Do screen plot after scan (YES)?
   8) Range x axis with scan min and max (NO)?
  16) Force y\-axis minimum to zero (NO)?
  32) Use logarithmic y\-axis (NO)?
  64) Use background subtraction (NO)?
 128) Use high resolution plotting device (YES)?
        What kind of high\-res graphics (x11)?
 256) Draw large dots at points (YES)?
 512) Connect points with lines (YES)?
1024) Draw error bars (YES)?
      Sum of selections is 131.

The numbers before each question are added
and printed after all options are selected.
You can quickly select the same set of options by invoking
\fBsetplot\fP with that number.
.sp
Selecting option 1 causes the otherwise null macro
\fBscan_plot\fP to be defined as \fBrplot\fP. The
\fBrplot\fP macro creates updated plots during scans using
the internal plotting functions.
.sp
The various combinations of options 2 and 4
are used to select a definition for the
\fBplot\fP macro, which is invoked at the end of each scan.
The \fBplot\fP macro will be defined to
possibly include the macros \fBsplot\fP and \fBlp_plot\fP.
The \fBsplot\fP macro uses the internal plotting and screen formatting functions
to plot the current data on the screen,
while the \fBlp_plot\fP macro uses the internal plotting functions
to plot data on a 132\-column printer.
In any case, the \fBplot\fP macro includes the
\fBplot_res\fP macro, which prints out summary information from the scan.
.sp
Selecting option 8 forces the scan data to encompass the entire
\fBx\fP axis.  Otherwise the
\fBx\fP\-axis ranges are rounded out to rational numbers.
.sp
Option 16 forces logarithmic scaling for the \fBy\fP axis.
.sp
Option 32 forces the minimum for the
\fBy\fP axis to be zero, no matter where the data points lie.
.sp
Option 64 selects a different method of doing the scan
analysis.
When this option is selected, a linear background is calculated for
each scan using the scan endpoints.
The number of endpoints that are averaged together is given by the global
variable \fBbg_pts\fP (default is 1).
The resulting linear background is subtracted from each point.
The quantities printed out as the peak position, sum, FWHM and center of the
FWHM are calculated after the background is subtracted.
.sp
Option 128 selects high\-resolution graphics mode.
If selected, you will be prompted for the high\-resolution device
you are using.  Recognized device names include
\fBvga\fP, \fBega\fP, \fBherc\fP, \fBsun\fP and
\fBx11\fP. By default, the high\-resolution plots are drawn with large dots
around each point and lines connecting the points.
Options 256 and 512 allow you to turn the dots and lines off.
Also by default, error bars are drawn, with the height of each error bar
proportional to the square root of the
\fBy\fP values, as appropriate for counting statistics.
Option 1024 lets you turn off error\-bar mode.
\fBspec\fP initially uses the value of the environment variable
\fBGTERM\fP, which can be set in your
\fB.login\fP file, to select the type of high resolution display you are using.
(You can, however, change
\fBGTERM\fP while \fBspec\fP is running.

\fBBG\fP
\- 
global variable holding a flag that if set, indicates
to use the background\-subtracted data in the analysis results and
plots produced by the \fBplot\fP macro.  It is important to make sure the
\fBdo_bg\fP macro is called to calculate the background\-subtracted data before
using macros such as \fBpl_FWHM\fP that look at the value of
\fBBG\fP to determine which data group to analyze.
The various standard definitions for the
\fBplot\fP macro will call \fBdo_bg\fP when appropriate.

\fBPLOT_MODE\fP

global variable containing the code representing

endpoints of a scan to average together to calculate the linear background.
