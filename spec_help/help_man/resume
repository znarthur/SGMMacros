\fBresume [n|\-n]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBresume\fP macro (also called \fBscan_on\fP) resumes
a scan that was previously aborted.
With a positive argument, \fBn\fP points are skipped.
A negative argument redoes the previous \fBn\fP points.
.sp
For example, \fBresume \-1\fP redoes the previous point, while
\fBresume 3\fP skips the next three points.
Giving a very large number will force the end\-of\-scan plots, etc.,
without taking any more data points.
