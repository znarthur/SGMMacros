.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBstartup\fP macro lets you change the default parameters
that are used by many of the macros in the standard library.
The \fBstartup\fP macro gathers together initialization macros such as
\fBnewfile\fP, \fBsetscans\fP, \fBsetplot\fP and \fBstartgeo\fP into one place. Also,
\fBstartup\fP prompts you for a title,
the name of a command file
directory, the default count time and the updated\-move\-and\-count
update interval.
.sp
The title you enter will appear in the scan headers that
are printed in the data file and on the screen.
.sp
The command file directory name is used by the \fBdo\fP and \fBqdo\fP macros.
These macros look for command files in the command file directory
if they are not in the current directory.
If you want to keep your \fBspec\fP command files in a special directory,
you can enter that directory name.
Otherwise, you can enter a single dot to indicate the current directory.
.sp
The default count time is initially one second and is used by the
\fBct\fP and \fBuct\fP macros as the count time if no arguments are given.
.sp
The update time controls how often the motor controllers or counters
are read and the readings displayed on the screen during updated
moving and counting.  The default value is 0.25 seconds.
Setting the value to zero is allowed, and causes the hardware registers
to be read as often as possible.  Entering zero or
a small value may slow down other processes on the computer, though,
so beware if you or someone else is trying
to do something else from another window or terminal.
