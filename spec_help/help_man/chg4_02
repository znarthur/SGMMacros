.SH "RELEASE 4.02.04"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 4.02.04 as of May 12, 1997.
.SH "New Tty Control In \fBtty_move()\fP and \fBtty_fmt()\fP"
.sp
All the tty attribute\-control strings available with the
\fBtty_cntl()\fP
function can now be included in special character sequences (as in
\fB\e[md]\fP
and
\fB\e[me]\fP
to start and end bold mode, for example) in the strings passed to the
\fBtty_move()\fP
and
\fBtty_fmt()\fP
functions.
.SH "New \fBend_mac\fP Built\-In Macro"
.sp
If a macro named
\fBend_mac\fP
is defined, its contents will be executed when \fBspec\fP
exits in normal fashion.
The
\fBend_mac\fP
macro will not be run if \fBspec\fP is killed or exits due to a fatal error.
If there is an error while executing the commands in
\fBend_mac\fP,
\fBspec\fP will exit anyway, and the
\fBend_mac\fP
macro will remain defined.
.SH "2D Associative Arrays Enhanced"
.sp
The following syntax using 2D associative arrays is now available:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
test["index1"]["val0"] = "data0"
test["index1"]["val2"] = "data2"
test["index2"]["val1"] = "data1"
test["index2"]["val3"] = "data3"

for (i in test["index1"])
        print i, test["index1"][i]

if ("val2" in test["index1"])
        print "yes"

.RE
.SH "GPIB and CAMAC Sharing Fixed"
.sp
The HP SICL GPIB controller can now be configured as a shared controller.
GPIB problems that occurred when the KS 3929 SCSI\-to\-CAMAC
controller was configured as shared but the GPIB controller was not
have been fixed.
.SH "Fixed Motion Bug With Large Backlash and Move Magnitudes"
.sp
A very old bug, where motor backlash movements didn\(aqt get done when
the product of the backlash magnitude and the move magnitude exceeded
the maximum value for a long integer, has been fixed.
.SH "Code For Princeton Instruments ST116 PDA Fixed"
.sp
Support for the ST116 PDA has been updated to work with \fBspec\fP release
4.
The
\fBmca_get()\fP
routine now returns the number of points read, as is the current convention.
The status byte sent by the instrument at the end of the data stream
and formerly returned by
\fBmca_get()\fP
is now available
using
\fBmca_par("status_byte")\fP.
.SH "Command Completion Tuned"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now does context\-dependent command completion for the
\fBlsdef\fP,
\fBundef\fP,
\fBprdef\fP,
\fBlscmd\fP,
\fBsyms\fP
and
\fBunglobal\fP
commands when linked with the GNU readline library.
(Command completion lists the possible valid completions or fills in
a unique completion when the
\fB<tab>\fP
key is pressed after partial input.)
.SH "\fBx11filt\fP Core Dump Fixed"
.sp
A bug that sometimes caused a core dump from the X11 filter program
\fBx11filt\fP
when
\fBDISPLAY\fP
could not be opened has been fixed.
.SH "RELEASE 4.02.03"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 4.02.03 as of April 18, 1997.
.SH "Wizard Password Can Be In a \fBSPECD\fP\fB/passwd\fP File"
.sp
The \fBspec\fP wizard password can now be located in
a file named
\fBpasswd\fP
in the \fBspec\fP auxiliary file directory (useful if
shadow passwords are used, as the shadow file containing the encrypted
password can be read only by root).
The format of the file is the same as in the conventional
\fBpasswd\fP
file, although this file need only contain the one line for the
\fBspecwiz\fP
user.
The wizard password is used with the
\fB^W\fP
command in the
\fBedconf\fP
configuration editor and with wizard mode with the
\fBspec_par("specwiz", 1)\fP
function.
.SH "The \fBuct\fP and \fBcounters\fP Macros Fixed Up"
.sp
The
\fBcounters\fP
macro will now check that the scaler channels are within range.
The
\fBuct\fP
macro will now print only the first six counters, if there are more than six
counters configured.
Note, the
\fBuctn\fP
macro can provide an updated display of more than six counters.
.SH "Support For Bit 3 VME Workstation Controllers Fleshed Out"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports access to the full A32 and dual\-port memory address
space, including
DMA transfers to and from \fBspec\fP data arrays, with the
Bit 3 Model 466\-1/467\-1 VME controllers on Sun platforms and the Model
487\-1 VME controller on HP platforms.
.SH "Support For Princeton Instruments CCD Camera Controllers Improved"
.sp
The code for the Princeton Instruments CCD camera controllers has been
revised a bit.
\fBKinetics\fP
mode is now supported.
The
\fBimage_par()\fP
function argument
\fB"kinetics"\fP
is used to turn the mode on or off.
The argument
\fB"kinwinsize"\fP
is used to set the number of rows in the kinetics\-mode window.
.SH "Bug Fixed With 0xFF Printed After Parsing Macro Functions"
.sp
Odd behavior, introduced with the recent fix of an obscure bug dealing
with parsing macro functions, where a character with ASCII value 255
would be sent to the screen after a macro function was parsed, has been
corrected.
.SH "RELEASE 4.02.02"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 4.02.02 as of March 31, 1997.
.SH "New \fBvme_move()\fP Function"
.sp
A new
\fBvme_move()\fP
function copies data between VME A32 address space and \fBspec\fP data arrays.
See the
\fI\%vme\fP help file for more information.
.SH "Macro Source Files Displayed With \fBprdef\fP"
.sp
The
\fBprdef\fP
command will now display (as a comment)
the name of the source file in which the
macro was defined.
This feature, which is on by default, can be disabled using
\fBspec_par("show_prdef_files", 0)\fP.
.SH "Can Now Configure Parity For \fBraw\fP Serial Interface"
.sp
The options
\fBraw evenp\fP
and
\fBraw oddp\fP
can now be selected on the Interfaces screen of the configuration
editor for generic serial devices.
.SH "Bug with \fBcdef()\fP Fixed"
.sp
Using the chained macro function
\fBcdef()\fP
with just one argument will create an empty macro with the given name.
If the macro already exists, it will do nothing.
Previously, such usage was undefined.
.SH "\fBfile_info()\fP Bug Fixed"
.sp
A bug with the new
\fBfile_info()\fP
function, where use with a single argument to test
for the existence of a file
could result in a segmentation violation,
has been fixed.
.SH "Bit 3 VME Support on Sun Platforms"
.sp
The Bit 3 S\-BUS VME controllers for SunOS 4.x and Solaris 2.x
platforms are now supported.
.SH "New Feature For NSK Motor Controller"
.sp
The function
\fBmotor_par(mne, "read")\fP
will now return the strings read for the NSK motor controller.
.SH "Tweak Macro Enhanced"
.sp
You can now change the tweak step size in the
\fBtw\fP
macro by typing a numerical value at the
\fBtw\fP
prompt.
.SH "More Flexible ESRF Format Read"
.sp
The
\fBfmt_read()\fP
function for the ESRF data\-file format now works with headers that are
not exactly 1024 bytes long.
.SH "Additions To \fBgmci\fP Geometry"
.sp
The
\fBgmci\fP
geometry, as used at CEA in Grenoble, now includes
the latest revisions from the users there.
.SH "RELEASE 4.02.01"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 4.02.01 as of March 9, 1997.
.SH "New Default X11 Plot Titles"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now sets the default X11 plot title to the name by name of
the running program followed by the filter number as in
\fBfourc 1\fP,
\fBfourc 2\fP,
\fBsixc 1\fP,
etc.
The plot title can still be changed using
\fBplot_cntl("title=...")\fP.
.SH "Improved File\-Write Error Handling"
.sp
When there is a write error on output to a file, \fBspec\fP will turn off
further output to the file until there is a
\fBon()\fP
or
\fBopen()\fP
call.
That gives the user an opportunity to
\fBclose()\fP
the file if no further output is possible, due perhaps to
a down NFS connection.
Previously, \fBspec\fP would continue attempts to flush any pending output, even
after write errors.
.SH "New \fBxxx_par(... \(dqdevice_id\(dq)\fP Partially Implemented"
.sp
The
\fBmotor_par()\fP,
\fBcounter_par()\fP,
\fBmca_par()\fP,
\fBmca_spar()\fP
and
\fBimage_par()\fP
functions all now take a new
\fB"device_id"\fP
parameter.
In the case of ESRF device server devices, the return value is the
string name of the imported device.
For some ESRF devices, the return value will be
\fB"?"\fP
if the device was not successfully imported.
For non\-ESRF devices, the return value may be
\fB"?"\fP or some other identifier such as GPIB address or CAMAC slot.
.SH "\fBexit\fP Bug In Macro Functions Fixed"
.sp
A bug, whereby an
\fBexit\fP
command in a macro function didn\(aqt reset to command level,
has been fixed.
.SH "Mnemonic Checking Fix Fixed"
.sp
The 4.01.15 fix to prevent the same mnemonic being used for both a
motor and a counter led to some problems when restarting \fBspec\fP after
it terminated abnormally.
Now the mnemonics are kept straight.
.SH "\fBscans.4\fP Fix For \fB@A\fP Array Data"
.sp
A bug in
\fBscans.4.c\fP,
where
\fB\e\fP
continuation lines of
\fB@A\fP
array data were not ignored when the MCA data wasn\(aqt asked for,
has been fixed.
.SH "X25 \fBsurf\fP Modifications"
.sp
The
\fBsurf\fP
geometry for the NSLS X25 diffractometer will now work with either
a one\- or two\-motor detector\-height stages.
.SH "Distinct Configuration For NI GPIB\-ENET"
.sp
There is now a distinct configuration choice for the
National Instruments GPIB\-ENET controller on platforms that
support that device.
With the GPIB\-ENET configuration selected, \fBspec\fP will block keyboard
signals during calls to the subroutines in the NI
\fBcib.o\fP
module, as
experience has shown those routines
are not rebust with respect to signals.
.SH "More Changes For the MM2500/ITL09 Motor Controllers"
.sp
On the advice of the manufacturer, \fBspec\fP now sleeps for 100 msec
before reading a response to a command sent to the MM2500/ITL09
motor controllers.
Perhaps that will help.
