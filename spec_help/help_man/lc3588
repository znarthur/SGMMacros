.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The LeCroy 3588 Histogramming Memory Module is an MCA module that is used
in \fBspec\fP with the LeCroy 3512 Spectroscopy ADC module.
The 3588 is chosen in the \fBconfig\fP file as
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBCA_LC3588 = slot_number\fP
.RE
.sp
The module can be hardware configured for either 16K of 24\-bit wide channels
or 32K of 12\-bit wide channels.
\fBspec\fP currently only supports the first configuration.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.rs
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_get(g, e)\fP
\- 
gets data from currently selected group on the 3588, and transfers it to
element \fBe\fP of \fBspec\fP data group \fBg\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_put(g, e)\fP
\- 
writes data to the currently selected group on the
3588, taking it from element \fBe\fP of \fBspec\fP data group \fBg\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("clear")\fP
\- 
clears the channels of the current group.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("run")\fP
\- 
starts acquisition.  Note that the \fBtcount()\fP and
\fBmcount()\fP functions (used in the counting macros) will also start
acquisition.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("halt")\fP
\- 
stops acquisition.  Note that the 3588 will also be halted when the
\fBtcount()\fP and \fBmcount()\fP functions (used in the counting macros)
complete their count intervals or are aborted.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("group_size")\fP
\- 
returns the current group size.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("group_size", size)\fP
\- 
sets the group size to \fBsize\fP.
Legal values are 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 and 16384.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("select_group")\fP
\- 
returns the currently active group.  Groups are numbered starting at zero.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("select_group", group)\fP
\- 
set the active group to \fBgroup\fP. Groups are numbered starting at zero.
The number of possible groups depends on the group size.
If \fBgroup\fP is greater than the maximum number of groups,
the current group
is set to \fBgroup\fP modulus the maximum number of groups.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("readone", channel)\fP
\- 
returns the contents of channel number \fBchannel\fP.
The channel number is with respect to the current group.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("chan#")\fP
\- 
returns the contents of channel number \fB#\fP.
The channel number is with respect to the current group.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("chan#", value)\fP
\- 
sets channel \fB#\fP to \fBvalue\fP.
The channel number is with respect to the current group.
