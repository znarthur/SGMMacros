.SH "INTRODUCTION"
.rs
.sp
\fBspec\fP supports the Amptek PX4 over both USB and RS\-232C interfaces.
(USB support in \fBspec\fP is currently available on Linux and Mac OS X
platforms.) The serial baud rate is fixed at 57.6K.
.sp
In USB mode, the maximum number of data channels is 8,192.
With the serial interface, the PX4 can be configured for
up to 4,096 channels.
.sp
Multiple PX4 units can be configured for simultaneous use with \fBspec\fP.
When using the USB interface, the module serial number can be configured
in the \fBADDR\fP field of the configuration editor.
If the configured serial number or numbers are zero,
\fBspec\fP will assign the USB PX4 modules in the order they are discovered
on the USB bus.
.sp
The PX4 has many operational parameters.
Amptek provides Windows\-compatible software to control the PX4.
That software can read and create parameter configuration files that
are interchangeable with \fBspec\fP.
See the \fB"read_config"\fP and \fB"save_config"\fP options to
\fBmca_par()\fP below.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.rs
.sp
The standard MCA commands supported by \fBspec\fP are described in the
\fI\%mca\fP help file.
Of the standard functions, the Amptek PX4 MCA supports
\fBmca_get()\fP (but not \fBmca_put()\fP). The standard
\fBmca_par()\fP options
\fB"info"\fP, \fB"chans"\fP, \fB"max_chans"\fP, \fB"max_channels"\fP,
\fB"disable"\fP, \fB"auto_run"\fP, \fB"soft_preset"\fP,
\fB"auto_clear"\fP, \fB"native_type"\fP, \fB"run"\fP, \fB"halt"\fP,
\fB"clear"\fP, \fB"group_size"\fP
and \fB"select_group"\fP, are supported by the Amptek PX4 MCA.
.sp
The option \fB"npts"\fP is a synonym for \fB"group_size"\fP. The option
\fB"buffer"\fP is a synonym for \fB"select_group"\fP.
.sp
The \fB"auto_clear"\fP mode is on by default.
.sp
Options specific to the PX4 are described below.
