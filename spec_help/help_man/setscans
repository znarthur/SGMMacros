.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBsetscans\fP macro asks the following questions:
.sp
\fBSleep (settle) time before each scan point (0)?\fP
.sp
.RS 4m
Setting the sleep time to a nonzero value causes the scan macros
to delay for that many seconds before counting at each point.
.sp
The value entered here is assigned to the
\fB_sleep\fP global variable, which can also be assigned to directly.
.sp
The default value is zero.

."
\fBShow updated moving and counting during scans (NO)?\fP
\- 
This option turns on a feature where during moving and
counting in scans, the motor positions or scaler contents
are continually read and displayed on the screen.
This feature works by redefining the standard macros
\fB_count\fP and \fB_move\fP.
.sp
The default value is no.
.RE
.sp
\fBDo hklscan prescan limit\-check loops (YES)?\fP
.sp
.RS 4m
The prescan limit checks calculate motor positions for each point
of the reciprocal space scans before moving any motors.
On slower computers and for long scans these calculations can
be annoyingly slow.
You can disable these checks if you are reasonably sure your
scans will not take motors outside their configured limits.
Disabling prescan limit checks doesn\(aqt disable limit checking
during the actual moves.  Rather, it simply avoids having a scan
aborted because of an attempt to move to a reciprocal space
position that takes motors beyond their limits.
.sp
The value entered here is assigned to the \fB_pre_chk\fP global variable,
which can also be assigned a zero or nonzero value directly.
.sp
The default value is 1 (yes).
.RE
.sp
\fBSave motors to data file at each point for HKL scans (NO)?\fP
.sp
.RS 4m
Normally, \fBspec\fP doesn\(aqt write motor positions to the data file
at each point in a scan when scanning over reciprocal space coordinates.
The reason is that the motor
positions can be recovered, if necessary, from the
\fBHKL\fP coordinates that are saved, saving the motor positions can
double the size of the data file, and as a rule, users use
the reciprocal space coordinates rather than the motor positions
in subsequent analysis of the data.
However, if this option is selected,
the positions of the geometry\-related motors will
be saved at each point for all standard
\fBHKL\fP linear, arc, radial and mesh scans.
(This option was introduced to the standard macros
in \fBspec\fP release 5.05.01\-7.)
.sp
The value entered here is assigned to the \fB_sav_geo_mot\fP global variable,
which can also be assigned a zero or nonzero value directly.
.sp
The default value is 0 (no).
