.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The Newport Agilis AG\-UC2 and AG\-UC8 piezo controller modules are both
supported by spec.
The Agilis AG\-UC2 uses a USB interface while the AG\-UC8
can use either a serial or USB interface.
.sp
The AG\-UC2 controller handles two axes which can be operated simultaneously.
The AG\-UC8 has four channels, each of which functions as
a two\-axis AG\-UC2 for a total of eight axes.
However, only one of the two\-axis channels in the AG\-UC8 can be active at a time.
The settings and current positions for the channels
are not maintained in the AG\-UC8 when switching
from one two\-axis channel to the next.
\fBspec\fP\(aqs AG\-UC8 support handles the multiplexing transparently, making
it is possible to specify new positions for all eight actuators on the
AG\-UC8 in one command.
\fBspec\fP will take care of synchronizing parameters and moving the channels in sequence.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.rs
.sp
Select
"Newport Agilis (Serial)" as the controller type for both the AG\-UC2 and the AG\-UC8,
even when using the USB connection.
The Agilis models use an FTDI USB interface chip that
is recognized by drivers available on both \fBLinux\fP and Mac OS X.
The kernel driver makes
the device appear as a serial interface to \fBspec\fP.
.sp
On \fBLinux\fP, the standard \fBftdi_sio\fP kernel module is required.
Recent \fBLinux\fP kernels include recognition of the Agilis USB device IDs in the \fBftdi_sio\fP
driver.
For older kernels, edit a file in \fB/etc/module.d/\fP
(a file could be created named \fBlocal.conf\fP, for example) to add the line:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
options ftdi\-sio product=0x3000 vendor=0x104d
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
On OSX, the VCP driver available at the \fI\%ftdichip.com\fP must be installed.
The Newport Agilis USB vendor and product IDs need to be added to
the kernel extension \fBInfo.plist\fP file as explained in the \fI\%FTDI Technical Note 105\fP
available at the FTDI website.
Contact CSS for assistance, if needed.
.sp
If using a direct serial connection to the AG\-UC8, select a baud rate of 115200.
If connecting the AG\-UC2 directly or using the USB port on the AG\-UC8, the baud rate should be 921600.
.sp
In some configurations, the serial
communication between \fBspec\fP and the Agilis may need to be slowed.
Non\-standard optional parameters named \fB"wdelay"\fP and \fB"rdelay"\fP
can be set from the \fBD\fPevices screen of the configuration editor.
These parameters set a delay time before write commands to the Agilis
and before reading replies, respectively.
Units for the parameters are seconds.
A delay of 0.010 seconds has been needed in at least one installation.
\fBspec\fP limits the delay to a maximum of 0.5 seconds.
Type \fBp\fP from the \fBD\fPevices screen to create and edit nonstandard optional controller parameters.
The delays can only be set in the \fBconfig\fP file.
.sp
The step amplitude associated with the controller\(aqs
\fBSU\fP command can be configured as a nonstandard optional
parameter for each motor from the \fBM\fPotor screen of \fBspec\fP\(aqs hardware configuration editor.
There are separate parameters for positive and negative movements, named
\fB"amplitude+"\fP and \fB"amplitude\-"\fP.
.sp
An additional nonstandard optional parameter named \fB"PA_target"\fP can be configured to
set the target position used with the \fBhome\fP command, as explained in the next section.
.sp
Type \fBp\fP from the \fBM\fPotor screen to create and edit nonstandard optional motor parameters.
All three parameters can also be changed and examined within \fBspec\fP using \fBmotor_par()\fP,
whether or not they are added to the \fBconfig\fP file.
.SH "HOMING"
.rs
.sp
There are two types of home search implemented in \fBspec\fP for the Agilis
controllers.
The \fBchg_dial(mne, "lim+")\fP and \fBchg_dial(mne, "lim\-")\fP commands
will use the controller\(aqs \fBMV\fP command to send the actuator to the positive or
negative limit switches.
Of course, the command will only work with stages that have limit switches.
The movement can be done at four possible speeds, which are set using the
\fBhome_method\fP optional motor parameter as follows:
.sp
.RS 4m
.TS
;
l l .
1	5 steps/sec at defined step amplitude
2	100 steps/sec at maximum step amplitude
3	1700 steps/sec at maximum step amplitude
4	666 steps/sec at defined step amplitude
.TE
.RE
.sp
If the \fBhome_method\fP parameter is not set, method 4 will be used.
.sp
The second home search uses the \fBPA\fP command and is initiated with the \fB"home"\fP, \fB"home+"\fP
and \fB"home\-"\fP options to \fBchg_dial()\fP.
These are the options used with \fBchg_dial()\fP within \fBspec\fP\(aqs standard \fBhome\fP
macro.
All three options produce the same action on the Agilis.
.sp
With the \fBPA\fP command, the controller first moves the stage to the positive limit.
The stage is then moved to the negative limit while steps are counted.
The stage is moved back to the positive limit, then moved the number
of steps needed to position the stage at a specified percentage of the total distance.
That percentage is taken from the parameter \fB"PA_target"\fP, which can have a value from 0 to 100,
with a precision of one part in a thousand.
If unset, a value of 50 is used.
.sp
Note, the \fBPA\fP procedure can take a couple of minutes to perform.
However, the search can be interrupted with \fB^C\fP.
