.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The Nicomp TC\-100 Autocorrelator is selected in the config file as
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBRS_TC100 = /dev/ttyXX  baud_rate\fP
.RE
.sp
When running \fBedconf\fP (or the \fBconfig\fP macro),
use the \fBMCAs\fP section of the \fBDevices\fP screen
to select the Nicomp autocorrelator.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.rs
.sp
The \fBmca_par()\fP function controls the correlator behavior as follows:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("clock")\fP
\- 
returns the value of the current clock time parameter in microseconds.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("clock", value)\fP
\- 
sets the clock time parameter.  The units for
\fBvalue\fP are microseconds.  Valid clock times are of the form
\fBX.XeY\fP where \fBX.X\fP ranges from 0.1 to 1.6 and \fBY\fP ranges from 0 to 5.
Values outside these bounds will be rounded to the closest allowed value.
The new value takes effect on the next \fBrun\fP command.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("prescale")\fP
\- 
returns the value of the prescale factor.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("prescale", value)\fP
\- 
sets the value of the prescale factor.
Valid prescale values are from 1 to 99.
The new value takes effect on the next \fBrun\fP command.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("dbase_mode")\fP
\- 
returns the state of the baseline mode.
A return value of 1 means delayed baseline mode is in effect.
A return value of 0 means delayed baseline mode is off.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("dbase_mode", 1|0)\fP
\- 
sets the state of the baseline mode.
A value of 1 turns on delayed\-baseline mode.
A value of 0 turns it off.
The new mode takes effect on the next \fBrun\fP command.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("dbase")\fP
\- 
returns the value of the delayed baseline from the last data
obtained using \fBmca_get()\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("cbase")\fP
\- 
returns the value of the calculated baseline
from the last data obtained using \fBmca_get()\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("tcnts")\fP
\- 
returns the value of the total\-counts monitor channel
from the last data obtained using \fBmca_get()\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("pcnts")\fP
\- 
returns the value of the total\-prescaled\-counts monitor channel
from the last data obtained using \fBmca_get()\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("rtime")\fP
\- 
returns the value of the run\-time monitor channel
from the last data obtained using \fBmca_get()\fP in seconds.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("clear")\fP
\- 
clears the correlator.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("run")\fP
\- 
sends the current clock\-time, prescale and delayed\-baseline
parameters to the correlator and starts the correlator.
The \fBtcount()\fP and \fBmcount()\fP functions also start the correlator.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("halt")\fP
\- 
stops the correlator.
The correlator is also halted
when count intervals specified by
\fBtcount()\fP or
\fBmcount()\fP have elapsed, or when counting is aborted using a \fB^C\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("plot")\fP
\- 
reads off the real\-time data plot from the running correlator.
The data obtained is a very low resolution version
of the correlation function.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_get(g, e)\fP
\- 
reads the current data from the correlator, and stuffs
the data into the data group \fBg\fP element \fBe\fP.
.RE
.SH "MACROS"
.rs
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBclr\fP
\- 
clears the correlator.
.HP 5m
."
\fBrun\fP
\- 
starts the correlator.
.HP 5m
."
\fBhalt\fP
\- 
stops the correlator.
.HP 5m
."
\fBget\fP
\- 
reads the correlator data and plots it.
.HP 5m
."
\fBclk [clock_time]\fP
\- 
sets the clock time.
The macro prompts for a value if it is not given as an argument.
.HP 5m
."
\fBpre [prescale_factor]\fP
\- 
sets the prescale factor.
The macro prompts for a value if it is not given as an argument.
.HP 5m
."
\fBdbase [0|1]\fP
\- 
sets delayed\-baseline mode.
The macro prompts for a value if it is not given as an argument.
.HP 5m
."
\fBcbase\fP
\- 
prints the value of the calculated baseline from the last data read.
.HP 5m
."
\fBct [count_time]\fP
\- 
accumulates correlation function for \fBcount_time\fP seconds.
Plots the data at the end of count_time.
.HP 5m
."
\fBuct [count_time]\fP
\- 
accumulates correlation function for \fBcount_time\fP seconds.
Updates a low resolution display of the correlation function while counting.
.HP 5m
."
\fBqelsplot\fP
\- 
does a screen plot of the current data using labels appropriate
for a correlation function.
.HP 5m
."
\fBqelsfile\fP
\- 
saves the current data to the datafile.
After the data points are saved, two lines of information are saved as
.nf
\fB#U2 clock_time prescale cbase dbase\fP
\fB#U3 dbase_mode tcnts pcnts rtime\fP
.fi
.sp
.RE
.sp
where the parameters are, in order: the clock time, the prescale factor,
the values of the calculated and delayed baselines, a zero or one to indicate
if the delayed baseline was used, the total counts, the total prescaled
counts and the elapsed time from the correlator.
