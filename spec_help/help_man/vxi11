.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
\fBspec\fP user\-level VXI\-11 functions
connect and communicate with instruments (such as many digital oscilloscopes) that use
the VXI\-11 protocol.
The client/server protocol use the remote procedure call (RPC) model
and is described in the document
VXI 11 Revision (7/17/1995)
TCP/IP Instrument Protocol Specification,
available at \fI\%vxibus.org\fP.
The support in \fBspec\fP currently consists of the \fBdevice_read\fP
and \fBdevice_write\fP messages over the \fBcore\fP channel.  The
\fBabort\fP and \fBinterrupt\fP channels described by the protocol are not used.
.sp
The user\-level access is through
the functions \fBvxi11_get()\fP, \fBvxi11_put()\fP and
\fBvxi11_par()\fP.
.SH "BUILT\-IN FUNCTIONS"
.rs
.sp
Most of the function calls require a string in the form
\fB"host"\fP or
\fB"host:instrument"\fP as the first argument.
The \fBhost\fP can be specified by a symbolic name or by an IP address.
For most devices, there is only one instrument per IP address (or host),
and it is not necessary to specify the instrument name.
\fBspec\fP supplies the placeholder name \fBinst0\fP.
When an instrument name is required, the syntax is as above, where a colon separates the
host name from the instrument name.
In the syntax description below, the symbol \fBname\fP will be used
to represent both options.
.sp
The default timeout for the RPC \fBclnt_call()\fP operations is set to two seconds.
It doesn\(aqt appear possible to abort a nonresponsive
RPC call prior to the expiration of the timeout
with a \fB^C\fP.  Thus, do not make the timeout too large.
.sp
The following functions are available.  The syntax and behavior for the
\fBvxi11_get()\fP and \fBvxi11_put()\fP functions is very similar to \fBspec\fP\(aqs corresponding
user level I/O functions for \fI\%serial\fP, \fI\%socket\fP and \fI\%gpib\fP interfaces.
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBvxi11_get("name")\fP
\- 
Reads up 8192 bytes from the device.  A device will usually indicate
a read is finished by setting the end bit, resulting in the transfer
of less than the maximum number.
.HP 5m
."
\fBvxi11_get("name", n)\fP
\- 
Reads up to \fBn\fP bytes.
.HP 5m
."
\fBvxi11_get("name", d)\fP
\- 
Reads incoming bytes into the data array \fBd\fP. The size of
\fBd\fP determines how many bytes are to be read.
Sub\-array syntax can be used to limit the number of bytes.
The function returns the number of array elements read, or zero
if the read times out.
Note, no byte re\-ordering is done for short\- or long\-integer data, and
no format conversions are done for float or double data.
.HP 5m
."
\fBvxi11_get("name", mode)\fP
\- 
If \fBmode\fP is the string
\fB"byte"\fP, reads and returns one unsigned binary byte.
If \fBmode\fP is the string \fB"short"\fP, reads two binary
bytes and returns the short integer so formed.
If \fBmode\fP is the string \fB"long"\fP, reads four binary
bytes and returns the long integer so formed.
The last two modes work the same on both
\fBbig\-endian\fP and \fBlittle\-endian\fP platforms.
On both, the incoming data is treated as
\fBbig endian\fP. If the incoming data is \fBlittle endian\fP, use
\fB"short_swap"\fP or
\fB"long_swap"\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBvxi11_par("show")\fP
\- 
Lists the current open clients.
.HP 5m
."
\fBvxi11_par("info")\fP
\- 
Returns a string that lists the current open clients.
.HP 5m
."
\fBvxi11_par("timeout" [, t])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets the default timeout for the RPC calls.
The units are seconds.
.HP 5m
."
\fBvxi11_par("name", "timeout" [, t])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets the timeout for the named device.
This value overrides the global default.
The units are seconds.
.HP 5m
."
\fBvxi11_par("name", "connect")\fP
\- 
Opens the RPC connection to the named device.  Returns true if successful
and false for failure.  Connections are created automatically with the
\fBvxi11_get()\fP and \fBvxi11_put()\fP functions.  It is not necessary to
use the \fB"connect"\fP option.  However, it may be useful to check if
a connection is possible.  There is no difference in behavior for a
connection opened using this \fB"connect"\fP option or one opened
automatically with \fBvxi11_get()\fP or \fBvxi_put()\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBvxi11_par("name", "close")\fP
\- 
Closes the RPC connection to the named device and frees associated resources.
Returns true whether or not the named device is open.  All connections are
closed during a \fBreconfig\fP.
