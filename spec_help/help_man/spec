.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
\fBspec\fP provides a software environment for the operation
of an X\-ray diffractometer
and other data\-acquisition instruments.  \fBspec\fP
contains a sophisticated command interpreter that uses a C\-like grammar
and is partially modeled on the standard UNIX utility
\fBawk\fP. \fBspec\fP supports a variety of X\-ray diffractometer configurations.
The diffractometer geometry is chosen by the program name.
Some of the more popular geometries currently supported include:
.sp
.RS 4m
.RS 0m
.HP 5m

\fBspec\fP
\- 
General instrument control and data acquisition

The following options are recognized:
.sp
.RS 4m
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-f\fP
\- 
Fresh start.
All symbols are set to their default values and
the standard macros are read to establish the default state.
.RE
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-F\fP
\- 
Clean and fresh start.
All symbols are set to their default values but
no command files are read and no macros are defined.
Only the built\-in commands are available.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-s\fP
\- 
Simulation mode.
No hardware commands are issued.
If started in simulation mode,
simulation mode cannot be turned off without restarting the program.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-y\fP
\- 
Yes, change motor controller registers initially if they disagree with the
\fBsettings\fP file.
Normally, \fBspec\fP requires you to confirm such a change.
This flag would be useful if you know controller power had been turned off.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-L\fP
\- 
Do not check or create the state\-file lock.
Normally, \fBspec\fP prevents more than one instance of itself using the same
user\-name plus terminal\-name derived state file.
In some situations, particularly if a site configures the state files
to reside on an NFS\-mounted disk, the lock test that spec uses
always indicates another
instance of \fBspec\fP is running, making it impossible to start.
This flag overrides that test.
Normally, this flag will not be used.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-d\fP \fBdebug\fP
\- 
Set the initial value of the debugging variable \fBDEBUG\fP to \fBdebug\fP.
See the \fI\%debug\fP help file for a list of the debugging categories.
A value of 192 is useful for debugging hardware problems.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-g\fP \fBgeometry\fP
\- 
Force loading of macro files and activation of geometry calculations
for the specified geometry,
while using the configuration files taken
from the name by which \fBspec\fP is invoked.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-N\fP \fBmy_name\fP
\- 
Use \fBmy_name\fP for setting the \fBspec\fP prompt
and the name of the configuration
file directory.  Also sets the geometry as if
\fB\-g\fP was given as an argument.
To select a geometry not corresponding to \fBmy_name\fP,
use the \fB\-g\fP flag after the \fB\-N\fP flag.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-u\fP \fBuser\fP
\- 
Use \fBuser\fP\(aqs last saved state as the current user\(aqs initial state.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-t\fP \fBtty\fP
\- 
Use the current user (or \fBuser\fP\(aqs) last saved state
from the terminal specified by \fBtty\fP.
The terminal can be specified as \fB\-t\fP \fB/dev/tty01\fP or
\fB\-t\fP \fBtty01\fP. Note, \fBspec\fP uses the string \fBttyp#\fP
to refer to a pseudoterminal.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-T\fP \fBfake_tty\fP
\- 
This option creates a user state associated with
\fBfake_tty\fP, which may be any name
(although only the first six characters are used).
This option allows you to bypass the locking feature that prevents multiple
instances of \fBspec\fP to be started by the same user
from the same terminal.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-o\fP \fBoption=value\fP
\- 
Initializes the \fBspec_par()\fP \fBoption\fP to \fBvalue\fP.
See the \fI\%spec_par\fP help file for a list of the available options.
Multiple \fB\-o\fP options may be given.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-C\fP \fBfile\fP
\- 
Open the command file
\fBfile\fP as a start\-up command file to be read
after the standard start\-up command files, but before the optional file
\fBspec.mac\fP in the current directory, which will always be read last.
If there is an error in reading or executing the commands in these files,
\fBspec\fP will jump to the main prompt and not read any remaining queued
command files.
Up to 32 files may be specified with multiple \fB\-C\fP options.
(This flag added in \fBspec\fP release 5.07.01\-1.)
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-D\fP \fBdirectory\fP
\- 
Use \fBdirectory\fP instead of the compiled\-in name (usually
\fB/usr/local/lib/spec.d\fP) or the value of the
\fBSPECD\fP environmental variable (if set)
as the auxiliary file directory.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-p\fP \fBfd pid\fP
\- 
Indicates that \fBspec\fP input is coming from a pipe from another program.
The argument \fBfd\fP is the file descriptor
that \fBspec\fP should use for standard input.
The argument \fBpid\fP is the process ID of the spawning process.
If \fBfd\fP is zero, \fBspec\fP will not re\-echo input
from the file descriptor to \fBspec\fP\(aqs standard output.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-S\fP
\- 
Starts \fBspec\fP in server mode listening at the first available port in
the default range of 6510 to 6530.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-S\fP \fBp1\fP
\- 
Starts \fBspec\fP in server mode listening
at the specified port number \fBp1\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-S\fP \fBp1\-p2\fP
\- 
Starts \fBspec\fP in server mode listening on the first available port
in the given range.
.HP 5m
."
\fB\-l\fP \fBoutputfile\fP
\- 
Specifies an output file.
Output to the file will begin immediately, so will include
the initial hardware configuration messages.
Files will be opened even when starting fresh.
(Added in \fBspec\fP release 5.09.02\-2.)
