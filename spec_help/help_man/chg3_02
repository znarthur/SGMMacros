.SH "RELEASE 3.02.02"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.02.02 as of April 4, 1995.
.SH "New \fBgetenv()\fP Function"
.sp
A new function
\fBgetenv(s)\fP
returns the string value of the environment variable
\fBs\fP.
.SH "\fBedconf\fP Asks To Confirm Rereading After Edits"
.sp
The hardware configuration editor
\fBedconf\fP
now asks you to confirm whether you want to reread the starting
or backup configurations (with the
\fBr\fP
or
\fBR\fP
commands) if you have made changes to the configuration before having
saved them.
.SH "Help File Format Changes"
.sp
The behavior of some of the
formatting sequences used in the \fBspec\fP help files has been
changed and some new sequences added.
The changes allow HTML versions of the files to be created using
\fBnroff\fP
or GNU
\fBgroff\fP.
See the comments in
\fBhelp/Makefile\fP
for information on that.
.SH "\fBEscan\fP Macro Change"
.sp
The
\fBEscan\fP
macro, when used with the
\fBfixQ\fP
option, now takes extra measures to ensure that
the position in reciprocal space does not drift.
.SH "\fBnewfile\fP Macro Revision"
.sp
The
\fBnewfile\fP
macro now
separates motor names by at least two spaces in the data file header.
.SH "New \fBcounter_par()\fP Options"
.sp
The
\fBcounter_par()\fP
function now supports the following arguments for all controllers:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fB"unit"\fP
\- 
returns the unit number of the indicated counter.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"channel"\fP
\- 
returns the channel number of the indicated counter.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"responsive"\fP
\- 
returns nonzero if the hardware appears to be working for the indicated
counter.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"controller"\fP
\- 
returns a string that indicates the controller type of the indicated
counter.
.RE
.SH "New \fBmotor_par()\fP Options"
.sp
The
\fBmotor_par()\fP
function now supports the following arguments for all controllers:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fB"unit"\fP
\- 
returns the unit number of the indicated motor.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"channel"\fP
\- 
returns the channel number of the indicated motor.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"responsive"\fP
\- 
returns nonzero if the hardware appears to be working for the indicated
motor.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"controller"\fP
\- 
returns a string that indicates the controller type of the indicated
motor.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"active"\fP
\- 
returns nonzero if the indicated motor is currently moving.
.RE
.SH "National Instruments GPIB Support for \fBlinux\fP"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports the
\fBlinux\fP
GPIB driver for the National Instruments AT\-GPIB card.
That driver is available via anonymous ftp from
\fBkoala.chemie.fu\-berlin.de\fP.
.SH "CAMAC E500 Channel Multiplexor Improvements"
.sp
The code for the E500 multiplexor
has been changed to insure that the multiplexed motors are always
restarted with consistent motor phases relative to the
last move of the particular motor.
In addition, if more than one multiplexed motor is commanded to move,
each such motor will automatically be moved in sequence.
The sequence is the order in which the motors
are numbered in the
\fBconfig\fP
file.
.SH "\fBcdef\fP Bug fixed"
.sp
A bug in the code that reads the portion of a user\(aqs state file
that stores the
\fBcdef\fP\-type
macros
has been fixed.
The bug could produce buffer overruns leading to unpredictable
side affects.
.SH "New D32 Surface Geometry"
.sp
A new
\fBsurf_d32\fP
configuration, as used at ESRF beamline D32, has been added.
.SH "RELEASE 3.02.01"
.rs
.sp
These
notes summarize the cumulative changes made for \fBspec\fP
release 3.02.01 as of February 18, 1995.
.SH "Expanded Syntax for \fBdata_plot()\fP and \fBdata_dump()\fP"
.sp
The element arguments to the
\fBdata_plot()\fP
and
\fBdata_dump()\fP
functions can now be combined in a single space\- or comma\-delimited
string.
This change will make a task such as
creation of plotting macros to plot a variable
numbers of curves in the same plot window easier.
.SH "Stand Alone Help File Viewer Now Included"
.sp
The \fBspec\fP
distribution now includes the stand alone CSS help file previewer
\fBchelp\fP.
This file will automatically be installed in the same directory as the
other executables.
.SH "\fBedconf\fP Treats Change In Step Size Differently"
.sp
Previously, changing the
step\-size parameter in the configuration editor caused the
accumulator value to change to keep the motor positions fixed.
Users have requested that the behavior be altered so that the
accumulator would remain fixed, but the user and dial
positions would scale
with the change in the step size parameter.
That change has been made.
.SH "More Efficient Output\-File Flushing"
.sp
Previously, \fBspec\fP flushed file output after each
print\-type command to an output file or device.
\fBspec\fP users have reported that
on certain platforms where the output was to an NFS\-mounted file system,
this frequent
flushing introduced considerable delays.
\fBspec\fP now performs flushing less frequently.
A
\fB"flush_interval"\fP
parameter, that can be set by the
\fBspec_par()\fP
function, specifies how many seconds to allow between output buffer
flushing.
The default
\fB"flush_interval"\fP
is
0.5 seconds.
If the interval is set to zero, the previous frequent\-flushing behavior
will be restored.
Output to the screen is still flushed immediately.
Output to other devices is also flushed each time
the main \fBspec\fP prompt is
issued.
.SH "Get Count Scale Factor"
.sp
The function
\fBcounter_par(mne, "scale")\fP
will return value of the scale factor set in the
\fBconfig\fP
file for the indicated counter.
.SH "New CAMAC \fBca_cntl()\fP Function"
.sp
A new function
\fBca_cntl()\fP
allows users to perform CAMAC initialize, clear and inhibit
crate operations from within \fBspec\fP on
all CAMAC controllers supported by \fBspec\fP.
Both
\fBca_cntl("Z")\fP
and
\fBca_cntl("init")\fP
issue the CAMAC Z (crate initialize) command.
Both
\fBca_cntl("C")\fP
and
\fBca_cntl("clear")\fP
issue the CAMAC C (crate clear) command.
The usage
\fBca_cntl("inhibit", 1)\fP
sets crate inhibit, while
\fBca_cntl("inhibit", 0)\fP
clears crate inhibit.
During normal operation, users should not need to issue these commands.
Users should probably issue a
\fBreconfig\fP
after sending a crate initialize or clear.
.SH "Increase In Number Of Devices That Can Be Configured"
.sp
The configuration editor
\fBedconf\fP
now allows entry of up to twenty rows each of information for non\-CAMAC
motor controllers and timer/counter devices, MCA\-type data acquisition
devices, generic serial devices and PC I/O port addresses.
The commands
\fB^F\fP
and
\fB^B\fP
select display of additional rows.
.SH "Optional Motor Configuration By Unit/Channel"
.sp
The configuration editor now allows entering of unit/channel
information for motors as an alternative to the automatic consecutive
unit/channel assignment normally used.
Note:  at present, only selected motor controllers
(E500, ESRF MAXE) in \fBspec\fP recognize
unit/channel information.
Unit/channel information, when used, must be enterned for all motors
associated with a particular type of motor controller.
Manual unit/channel numbering is turned on simply by entering
values in the form
\fBunit/channel\fP
in an otherwise blank cells.
Entering a single number changes just the channel number.
Entering
\fB^D\fP
turns off manual numbering.
No consistency checking is done on the assignment in the configuration
editor.
\fBspec\fP does check for consistency when reading the
\fBconfig\fP
file, though.
The config file uses the syntax
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
MOT012 = E500:0/3 ...
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
to store the unit/channel information.
.SH "New Motor Position Discrepancy Message (For Some)"
.sp
A new motor\-position discrepancy message has been deployed (currently for
selected motor controls only).
The new message gives hints to the appropriate course of action when
motor position discrepancies arise.
The new message is currently implemented for the following
motor controllers:
Oriel 18092, NSLS MMC32, Huber 9000, MicroControle ITL09, Klinger MM2000,
NSK, PI, EPICS motors and ESRF motors.
The rest of the motor controllers will be converted to the new message
shortly.
.SH "Fixed Recursion Bug With Undefined \fBcleanup\fP Macro"
.sp
A bug that under certain circumstances produced a continuous stream of
\fBcleanup: undefined\fP
messages has been fixed.
.SH "Memory Leaks Fixed"
.sp
A couple of small memory leaks in \fBspec\fP have been fixed.
Also, the
\fBmemstat\fP
command now does a more complete job of memory accounting, including
the addition of new
categories for memory allocated by
\fBcdef()\fP
macros
and memory allocated for configured hardware.
.SH "Macro Fix Involving \fBcalcG\fP"
.sp
To make it easier for users to work with a manually entered orientation
matrix,
the
\fBcalcG\fP
macro (which sets a flag to indicate
the orientation matrix should be recalculated
using the current values of the
lattice constants, orientation reflections and
X\-ray wavelength) has
been relocated to the
\fBsav_ub\fP
macro.
\fBcalcG\fP
was formerly included in the
\fBsavegeo\fP
macro (which is defined differently for each diffractometer geometry),
which calls
\fBsav_ub\fP.
(The
\fBsavegeo\fP
macro is called by the
\fBsave\fP
macro, which saves important parameters in a command file.)
For users who enter the orientation matrix manually, the
\fBsav_ub\fP
macro should be redefined with a macro that writes the contents of
\fBUB\fP
to the save file.
.SH "Improvements in Internal Pseudomotor Code"
.sp
Recent improvements in the internal code for pseudomotors have been
propagated to the
\fBgeo_sixc.c\fP,
\fBgeo_surf.c\fP,
\fBgeo_w21h.c\fP
and
\fBgeo_w21v.c\fP
source code.
The changes require use of the new internal C\-code functions
\fBset_pseudo_targ()\fP
and
\fBset_pseudo_pos()\fP.
Contact CSS for technical details on adding pseudomotors to
geometry code.
.SH "Motor/Counter Disabling Implemented"
.sp
The functions
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmotor_par(mne, "disable" [, 0|1])\fP
.RE
.sp
and
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBcounter_par(mne, "disable" [, 0|1])\fP
.RE
.sp
now work for all motors and counters to disable hardware access of
the indicated motor or counter.
All usable motors and counters are reenabled on startup and
\fBreconfig\fP.
.SH "MCA\-type Devices Can Be Disabled"
.sp
Normally MCA\-type
devices are started and stopped the same as other
configured counters
by the
\fBtcount()\fP
and
\fBmcount()\fP
functions.
The function
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmca_par("disable" [, 0|1])\fP
.RE
.sp
now allows that automatic starting and stopping to be disabled.
The command works on the device currently selected
with the
\fBmca_sel()\fP
function.
Such devices can still be started and stopped using
\fBmca_par("run")\fP
and
\fBmca_par("halt")\fP,
and will also  be stopped by a
\fB^C\fP
typed at the keyboard.
.SH "New \fBmca_put()\fP Function"
.sp
A new function
\fBmca_put(g, e)\fP
is available.
For certain MCA\-type devices, this function will send the data in
data group
\fBg\fP
element
\fBe\fP
to the device.
.SH "CAMAC Block Mode Transfers For Selected Controllers"
.sp
CAMAC block mode transfers are now implemented for the Kinetic Systems
3929 SCSI\-CAMAC controller on HP 700 platforms and for the Kinetic Systems
3988 GPIB\-CAMAC controller.
Block modes transfers are used by some MCA\-type modules.
.SH "More CAMAC Presence Tests"
.sp
Simple
CAMAC presence tests have been added for
the Kinetic Systems 3512 and 3610,
the DSP QS450,
and the LeCroy 2301, 3512 and 3588 modules.
These tests simply see if a module in the selected slot responds to
a suitable CAMAC command.
The test can\(aqt confirm whether the appropriate module is present.
Presence tests for CAMAC modules such as the Kinetic Systems 3640 and the
DSP E500, where the module can return a unique ID, continue to be
performed.
.SH "Changes For the CAMAC E500"
.sp
Several changes have been made in the code for the DSP E500
motor controller.
The E500 will no longer make moves smaller than the backlash
at the base rate.
Rather, the normal acceleration profile will be used.
In addition, the E500 will no longer read all the configured motors with
each
\fBgetangles\fP.
Rather, positions will be read during hardware configuration, at the end of
moves, on
\fBsync\fP
commands and while moving.
Also, the motor positions will not be checked for consistency with the
controller before each move, as was done historically.
Finally, the E500 code will recognize the new, optional
unit/channel configuration information that may be present in the
\fBconfig\fP
file.
.SH "Changes For the CAMAC KS 3640"
.sp
The Kinetic Systems 3640 no longer asserts and clears crate inhibit
during counting.
.SH "Changes For the CAMAC LeCroy 2301"
.sp
The LeCroy 2301 MCA buffer now implements the
\fBmca_par("chan#")\fP
to read the contents of channel
\fB#\fP
and
\fBmca_par("chan#", value)\fP
to set the contents of channel
\fB#\fP.
Also the module supports the new
\fBmca_put()\fP
function.
In addition, the LeCroy 2301
now uses CAMAC block\-mode transfers on
CAMAC controllers where \fBspec\fP supports such transfers.
.SH "Changes For the CAMAC DSP 2190/4101"
.sp
The DSP 2190 MCS Averager/4101 Histogramming Memory
now uses CAMAC block\-mode transfers on
CAMAC controllers where \fBspec\fP supports such transfers.
.SH "Changes For ESRF MAXE Motor Controllers"
.sp
There is now no longer a
limit within \fBspec\fP on the number of MAXE controllers that
can be configured.
The MAXE controller supports the new unit/channel motor configuration
option.
.SH "Bug With ACS MCB Motor Controller Fixed"
.sp
A bug in the code in the ACS MCB motor controllers, where rate
parameters may not have been set
correctly for certain motors, has been fixed.
.SH "Better \fBedconf\fP on HP700 Platforms"
.sp
On the hp700 platforms, the configuration editor
\fBedconf\fP
is now built with the
HP V.4 Curses Library
(\fBlibcur_colr.a\fP).
This library fixes bugs in the less\-than\-optimal
screen updating of the standard curses library.
The version of
\fBedconf\fP
shipped with \fBspec\fP will be statically linked with this library, since
it is not part of the standard HP\-UX
.q instant\-ignition
installation (although it is
included on the HP\-UX distribution media).
