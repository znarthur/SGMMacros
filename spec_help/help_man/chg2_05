.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
These notes summarize the modifications made for \fBspec\fP release 2.5,
as finalized on May 11, 1988.
.SH "CHANGES"
.rs
.sp
Each motor now has three levels of security: 1) no protection,
2) limits cannot be changed and 3) motor cannot be moved.
.sp
When using edconf to alter the configuration file, limits no longer
track changes to the accumulator, however they still follow
changes to the dial setting.
.sp
The name of the standard macro file has been changed from
\fB/usr/lib/spec.d/spec.mac\fP
to
\fB/usr/lib/spec.d/standard.mac\fP.
.sp
The DSP CAMAC driver has been fixed to enable slot 16 to work.
In addition, each time a process opens the driver when no other
process has it open, a CAMAC
\fBZ\fP
(initialization command) is issued.
.sp
A new macro
\fBwm\fP,
\fB"where motor"\fP,
prints positions and limits for up to six motors.
.sp
A new macro
\fBvi\fP
invokes the editor called
\fBvi\fP.
.sp
A new macro
\fBmail\fP
invokes the mailer called
\fBmailx\fP.
.sp
A new macro
\fBbug\fP
lets the user enter a message that is then mailed to the
administrator,
\fBspec_adm\fP.
.sp
A new macro
\fBsplot\fP
plots the current data on the video screen.
.sp
The geometry status macros
\fBwh\fP,
\fBca\fP,
\fBci\fP,
etc., will now
only print the positions of the four\-circle motors.
.sp
\fBMOTORS\fP
is now a built\-in symbol, automatically
set to the number of configured motors when the
\fBconfig\fP
file is read.
.sp
On first reading of the standard macros, if the four\-circle motors
are not configured in the standard positions (0\-3), the motor
indirection array
(\fB_A[]\fP)
is automatically initialized.
.sp
The four\-circle diffractometer macro set and C code
has been improved, including better diagnostics when trying to go to
unreachable positions and bug fixes.
The
\fBReference Manual\fP
now contains a complete description of the
four\-circle interface.
Among the new four\-circle macros to set geometry parameters
(each will prompt if invoked without arguments) are
\fBsetmode\fP
to set the mode,
\fBsetsector\fP
to set the sector,
\fBsetlat\fP
to set the crystal lattice parameters and
\fBsetaz\fP
to set the azimuthal reference vector.
.sp
The state file is no longer saved if the user exits using
\fB^Z\fP.
.sp
The plotting interface has been revised.
Consult the
\fBReference Manual\fP
for details.
.sp
The
\fBwait()\fP
function can now be invoked to return a value indicating
if any asynchronous activity is going on.
.sp
New built\-in functions
\fBexp10(x)\fP
and
\fBpow(x, y)\fP
are available.
The former returns 10 to the
\fBx\fP,
the latter,
\fBx\fP
to the
\fBy\fP.
