\fBdscan\fP (also called \fBlup\fP) scans one motor,
as specified by \fBmotor\fP. If the motor is at position
\fBX\fP before the scan begins, the scan will run from
\fBX+start\fP to \fBX+end\fP.
The step size is \fB(start\-end)/intervals\fP.
The number of data points collected will be \fBintervals+1\fP.
Count time is given by \fBtime\fP, which if positive, specifies
seconds and if negative, specifies monitor counts.
.sp
Upon termination, the motor is returned to its starting position.
