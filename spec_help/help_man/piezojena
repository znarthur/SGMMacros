.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The Piezosystem Jena Voltage Amplifier is
a controller for up to three piezo actuators.
\fBspec\fP has been tested with model NV40/3CLE, but
should also work with models NV40/3, NV120/1 and
NV120/1CLE.
The Piezosystem Jena controller
has both serial and USB interfaces, although
\fBspec\fP accesses the USB as a serial
interface using the standard USB\-to\-serial
drivers available on modern \fBLinux\fP and OS X
platforms.
See
\fI\%www.piezojena.com\fP for details on the hardware.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.rs
.sp
From \fBspec\fP\(aqs hardware configuration editor (\fBedconf\fP, normally run from the
\fBconfig\fP macro),
select the controller type and
assign the interface parameters along the following lines:

On the \fBM\fPotor
screen of the configuration editor, choose the controller type as
\fBPZOJENA\fP.
The steps\-per\-degree parameter should be set to 10000.
The slew rate, base rate and acceleration time are not used by \fBspec\fP
for this controller.  Several of the standard optional motor parameters,
reached by typing a lower case \fBm\fP from the main motor configuration screen,
are recognized by \fBspec\fP for this controller and may be useful, as
described below.
.sp
There is no status available from the
controller as to whether the move has completed or if the stage
is on target, so moves are considered complete
immediately after sending the move command.
A delay can be added by
configuring the optional settle\-time and dead\-band parameters.
.sp
To configure a settle time at the end of each move, set the optional
parameters DC dead band (\fB"dc_dead_band"\fP)
and DC settle time (\fB"dc_settle_time"\fP).
If both of these parameters are configured,
\fBspec\fP will wait
for at least the time given by the settle time before reporting the move complete.
In addition, \fBspec\fP will also wait
for the difference between the target position and
the actual position to be within the dead band.
If the motor doesn\(aqt settle within five seconds, \fBspec\fP reports an error.
.sp
The read\-back slop parameter (\fB"slop"\fP)
can be used to suppress position discrepancy messages.
If the slop parameter is set to some number of steps,
\fBspec\fP will not report position discrepancies
smaller than that value and will instead silently accept the reported
hardware value as the position.
.sp
The hardware read\-mode parameter (\fB"read_mode"\fP)
controls when the position is read
from the hardware and can also tell \fBspec\fP to always accept the reported
hardware value, no matter how large the discrepancy between it and the software position.
\fBspec\fP normally assumes a motor is at its last position.
If the \fBPREMOVE\fP read\-mode option is set,
\fBspec\fP will always read the hardware before
moving the motor.  If the
\fBALWAYS\fP option is set, \fBspec\fP will read the hardware whenever the
\fBget_angles\fP command is run from user level.
If the \fBNO QUERY\fP option is set,
\fBspec\fP will always assume the hardware is correct and not query
the user as to how to resolve the discrepancy
if the returned hardware position differs from the current software position.
Note, the \fB"slop"\fP parameter is not used
when the \fBNO QUERY\fP option is set,
.sp
There are a number of encoder parameters associated with the controller that affect
all channels.  These parameters are named to match the commands used to program the
controller:
\fB"encmode"\fP,
\fB"enctime"\fP,
\fB"enclim"\fP,
\fB"encexp"\fP,
\fB"encstol"\fP and
\fB"encstcl"\fP.
(See the controller user manual for details on the meaning of the parameters.)
These parameters can be set as non\-standard optional parameters on the
\fBD\fPevice screen associated with the controller by typing a lower case \fBp\fP
when the row containing the controller is highlighted.
Parameters set in the \fBconfig\fP file this way can be accessed using
\fBmotor_par()\fP, but are read only.
These parameters can also be set as non\-standard optional parameters
associated with a single motor channel by typing \fBp\fP
from the
\fBM\fPotor screen.
Parameter values set this way can be accessed via \fBmotor_par()\fP for both
reading and writing.
Although the parameter is assigned to a particular motor channel, the value
affects all channels on the same controller.
If different values are set for different motor channels, the
value set for the highest numbered motor will be the value sent to the controller.

."
\fBmotor_par(mne, "cloop" [, 0|1])\fP
\- 
Sets or returns the current operating mode
for the actuator \fBmne\fP.
A value of 1 sets or
indicates closed\-loop mode.  A value of 0 sets or indicates
open\-loop mode.  This parameter can also be set as a non\-standard
optional motor parameter in the \fBconfig\fP file.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(mne, "fenable" [, 0|1])\fP
\- 
Sets or returns the soft\-start setting

entire range of motion on power up.
.HP 5m

\fBmotor_par(mne, "monwpa" [, 0|1|2])\fP
\- 
Sets or returns the the value for the monitor output configuration
for the actuator \fBmne\fP.
A value of 0 sets it to actuator voltage.  A value of 1 sets the output
to a value proportional to the position (if the hardware has that functionality).
A value of 2 sets the output to the actuator voltage when in open\-loop mode
and proportional to the position when in closed\-loop mode.
