.SH "INTRODUCTION"
.rs
.sp
This help file describes the \fBspec\fP support for
the Amptek DP5, PX5, DP5G and MCA8000D (and products derived from those)
using Amptek\(aqs version 6 firmware.
In the following text, although DP5 is named explicitly, the descriptions
apply to all the above models.
.sp
The \fBspec\fP support for the DP5 is available over serial, USB
and ethernet interfaces.
.sp
Not all functionality available on the DP5 is currently included in the
\fBspec\fP support.  If a missing feature is needed, please contact CSS.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.rs
.sp
The DP5 is configured on the MCA\- and CCD\-type
\fBA\fPcquisition screen of the the configuration editor
along the following lines:

.RE
.sp
For the serial interface, \fBspec\fP sets the baud rate to 115200 when
initializing the device no matter what baud rate is set in the \fBconfig\fP
file, since the device only works at 115200 baud.
.sp
With the USB interface, the \fBADDR\fP field can optionally be set to the
module\(aqs serial number, which is useful if more than one DP5 is connected
via USB.  Otherwise it is not possible to distinguish one from the other
in the configuration.  If the \fBADDR\fP field is zero, the modules are
assigned in the order in which they are discovered on the USB interface,
which works fine if there is just one module.
.sp
For the socket interface, the \fBDEVICE\fP field contains a resolvable
hostname or an IP address.  The port number can be optionally appended
with a colon, as \fB192.168.1.13:10001\fP.  If missing, the default port, 10001
is used.  One can set the DP5 IP address using the \fB"ethernet"\fP option
to \fBmca_par()\fP as described below.
.sp
Note, the DP5 firmware requires a 15 second timeout period after closing
the socket connection before the socket can be reopened from the same IP
address.  Normally \fBspec\fP\(aqs \fBreconfig\fP command closes and reinitializes
sockets connections.  For the DP5, \fBspec\fP keeps the socket connection open across
a \fBreconfig\fP if the DP5 configuration remains unchanged. If the \fBDEVICE\fP
string is altered or if \fBspec\fP
is quit and restarted within 15 seconds, the DP5 socket access will fail until
the timeout period on the DP5 completes.  \fBspec\fP will detect this failure
and automatically pause for the required interval.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.rs
.sp
The standard MCA commands supported by \fBspec\fP are described in the
\fI\%mca\fP help file.
Of the standard functions, the \fBspec\fP MCA support for the Amptek DP5\-type devices
includes
\fBmca_get()\fP but not \fBmca_put()\fP.
In addition to the \fBmca_par()\fP options described below, the
the standard
\fBmca_par()\fP options
\fB"info"\fP, \fB"chans"\fP, \fB"max_chans"\fP, \fB"max_channels"\fP,
\fB"disable"\fP and
\fB"native_type"\fP are supported.
.sp
As explained in the \fI\%mca\fP help file, when more than one MCA is configured in \fBspec\fP
the \fBmca_sel()\fP command or the \fBmca_sget()\fP and \fBmca_spar()\fP commands can be used
to direct commands to particular modules.
.sp
In the \fBmca_par()\fP options described below, the argument parsing is case insensitive.
Either lower case or upper case may be used.  The DP5 requires upper case for
parameters sent to it.  \fBspec\fP
makes the conversion automatically.
.SH "STATE FILE"
.rs
.sp
Several parameters are saved in the user state file so that the values will
persist when restarting \fBspec\fP as the same user.
The parameters that are saved are those corresponding to \fB"npts"\fP (the number
of channels), the presets \fB"preset_time"\fP, \fB"preset_real"\fP, \fB"preset_live"\fP (for the MCA800D)
and \fB"preset_counts"\fP,
and the upper and lower region\-of\-interest (\fB"roi"\fP) limits.
In addition, the settings for \fB"auto_clear"\fP, \fB"auto_run"\fP and \fB"soft_preset"\fP
are saved.

When using the USB or serial interface,
if the DP5 fails to detect the ethernet chip, the command will fail with
the error message "CP2201 not found".
The problem can usually be solved by cycling the power on the DP5.

\fBmca_par("ethernet", "address [, gateway [, subnet]]")\fP
\- 
Sets the DP5 ethernet parameters for IP address, gateway address
and subnet mask.  Values are entered using the standard dotted\-decimal notation, as
shown in the previous display.
The gateway and subnet mask values are optional.  The gateway defaults to
an address with the first three elements of the IP address with a "\fB.1\fP"
in the fourth position.
The subnet mask defaults to \fB255.255.255.0\fP.
The following commands would set the same parameters:

\fBmca_par("run")\fP
\- 
If \fB"auto_clear"\fP mode is set, sends commands to clear the spectrum and scalers.
If a preset value is nonzero, programs the DP5 with either the preset accumulation time,
the preset real time or the preset counts.
Finally, sends the command to start acquisition.

\fBmca_par("halt")\fP

Sends the command to halt acquisition.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("auto_clear" [, 0|1])\fP
\- 
With no arguments returns the current value of auto\-clear mode.
Otherwise turns auto\-clear mode off or on.
When auto\-clear mode is on, the spectrum and scalers are cleared automatically
each time an acquisition is started.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("auto_run" [, 0|1])\fP
\- 
With no arguments returns the current value of auto\-run mode.
Otherwise turns auto\-run mode off or on.
When auto\-run mode is on, the DP5 is started automatically with the standard
\fBspec\fP count commands.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("soft_preset" [, 0|1])\fP
\- 
With no arguments, returns the current value of soft\-preset mode.
Otherwise turns soft\-preset mode off or on.
When soft\-preset mode is on in conjunction with auto\-run mode, the DP5 will
be programmed for the same preset accumulation time as the master timer when
counting to time, or the same preset counts as the master counter when counting
to preset counts.  \fBspec\fP will include the DP5 when polling for the end of
counting when soft\-preset mode is on.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("npts" [, value])\fP
\- 
With no arguments, returns the current number of points configured for the DP5
spectrum.  Otherwise sets the number of points to \fBvalue\fP.
Allowed values are 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 and 8192.
Setting the DP5 number\-of\-channels parameter \fBMCAC\fP has the same effect.

\- 
With no arguments, returns the value for the current preset counts.

\fBmca_par("roi" [, lower, upper])\fP
\- 
With no arguments, returns the number of channels in the current region
