.SH "RELEASE 4 \- text in preparation"
.rs
.sp
These
notes describe the general features added to \fBspec\fP for release 4.
.SH "Introduction"
.sp
\fBspec\fP release 4 has been in the works for many months.
It includes many new features
to make the program easier to use and to support new hardware devices.
One of the main reasons for the new release is to accommodate
two\-dimensional detectors.
To that end, a new array data type has been added, along with
functions and operators to work on the arrays.
.sp
Preliminary support for a number of CCD cameras is already available,
including models from Princeton Instruments and Photometrics.
.sp
Descriptions of the new features in release 4 follow.
.SH "New Macro Functions"
.sp
Macro function are now available.
Macros
can now be defined to return values and can be used as operands in
expressions.
The macro definition can include function arguments, which then
become available to the
body of the macro function.
For example,
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
def factorial(n) \(aq{
        if (n <= 1)
                return(1);
        return(n * factorial(n\-1))
}\(aq

.SH "New Array Data Type"
.sp
A new type of data array has been created.
Besides eventually replacing the never\-popular data groups in the
standard macros, the new arrays add new capabilities to \fBspec\fP.
Unlike \fBspec\fP\(aqs traditional
\fBassociative\fP
arrays,
which can be indexed by arbitrary numbers or strings and
which store elements in no particular order and not particularly
efficiently, the
new array data types are indexed by consecutive integers starting from zero
and store data in contiguous memory, allowing efficient access.
The new arrays must be declared and dimensioned with the new
\fBarray\fP
keyword
to allow \fBspec\fP to allocate memory for the array and to distinguish
the new arrays from the associative arrays.
See the
\fI\%arrays\fP help file for detailed information.
.SH "New CCD Camera Support"
.sp
Support for image acquisition using CCD cameras is now part of \fBspec\fP.
Currently hardware support is available for a Photometrics model
on an HP 700 platform, several Princeton Instruments models on
Sun platforms using
an S\-Bus SDV interface card and for the ESRF Frelon camera over several
interfaces.
Support for additional cameras will be added as user needs are made
known to CSS.
.sp
The
\fBimage_get()\fP,
\fBimage_put()\fP
and
\fBimage_par()\fP
functions are available for reading the image and controlling
the hardware.
Also, the new functions
\fBfmt_write()\fP
and
\fBfmt_read()\fP
allow the array data from the CCD cameras to be written to and read from
binary data files.
.SH "New Password Protection For Designated Motors"
.sp
A new option to the
\fBspec_par()\fP
function allows \fBspec\fP administrators to gain access to motors
locked out in the
\fBconfig\fP
file to ordinary users.
This features allows the administrator to position the motors
without having first to go into the configuration
editor to change access modes.
Entering
\fBspec_par("specwiz", 1)\fP
causes \fBspec\fP to prompt for the
\fB"Wizard\(aqs password"\fP.
If entered correctly, the characters
\fB_WIZ\fP
are appended to the prompt to remind the user of the special powers,
and motors configured with protected status can be moved.
Entering
\fBspec_par("specwiz", 0)\fP
disables the special mode.
The encrypted
specwiz
password is taken from the
\fB/etc/passwd\fP
file, just as with the
specwiz feature for the configuration editor.
.SH "New \fBsrand()\fP Function"
.sp
The new function
\fBsrand(value)\fP
sets the seed value for the random number generator used by the
\fBrand()\fP
function to the integer
\fBvalue\fP.
This feature allows the same sequence of random numbers to
be generated reproducibly by resetting the seed to the same value.
.SH "\fBwhatis()\fP Function Enhanced"
.sp
The
\fBwhatis()\fP
function now produces a text description of the object
specified by its first argument, if a second nonzero argument
is supplied.
The
\fBwhats\fP
macro takes advantage of the new syntax.
.SH "New MCA Features"
.sp
.RS 4m
.nf
mca_par("disable")
mca_get(array)
mca_put(array)
mca_spar(), mca_sput(), mca_sget()
numbering is fixed in config file with @
numbering needn\(aqt be consecutive
mca_sel("?")
ROI support
.fi
.sp
.RE
.sp
PCA\-II, PCA\-3, PCA Multiport implements array get/put
.SH "Can Dynamically Assign Monitor Channel"
.sp
For certain counters, the scaler channel used for the monitor preset
can be changed using the command
\fBcounter_par(mne, "monitor")\fP.
Counters that currently support this feature are the
KS 3640 CAMAC counter, the Joerger VSC16/8 VME scaler and the
generic EPICS scaler.
.SH "Unlimited String Length For \fBprintf()\fP Family"
.sp
There is no longer a limit to the lengths of strings that can be
printed or formatted using the
\fBprint\fP,
\fBprintf()\fP,
\fBsprintf()\fP
and
\fBfprintf()\fP
functions.
.SH "\fBser_get()\fP, \fBser_put()\fP Revised"
.sp
The
\fBser_get()\fP
function has been
revised, rationalized
ser_par(sel, "timeout")
.SH "Macro Facility Internals Rewritten"
.sp
The internal code for handling macros has been entirely rewritten.
Also, the internal copies of the
macros are now saved in the same file with the other state
information.
There are no more
\fBuserfiles/user_tty#M\fP
in the auxiliary file directory
.SH "New Version of GNU Readline Library Bundled"
.sp
A newer version of the GNU readline library is now bundled with \fBspec\fP.
.SH "Obsolete Functions and Commands Are Gone"
.sp
The long\-obsolete
\fBfixstate\fP
and
\fBgetstate\fP
commands are gone (although the once\-related
\fBsavstate\fP
command still exists).
The obsolete functions
\fBpl_xget()\fP,
\fBpl_yget()\fP,
\fBpl_put()\fP,
\fBpl_anal()\fP,
\fBpl_dump()\fP
and
\fBplot_pts()\fP
have been eliminated from the program, although, for the sake of
way\-backwards compatibility, the file
\fBmacros/compat.mac\fP
contains replacement definitions for the functions.
.SH "New Hardware Support"
.sp
Highland Tech VME HLV 544 motor controller
.sp
BI9000 correlator support
.sp
