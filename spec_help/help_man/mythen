.SH "INTRODUCTION"
.rs
.sp
The Dectris Mythen and Mythen2 are high\-dynamic range,
short readout time and high frame rate MCA models.
\fBspec\fP supports single and multiple frame acquisition,
optionally gated and/or triggered.
Connection to the Mythen is over a
UDP or TCP socket.
Multiple units can be configured for use at the same time.
.sp
The original Mythen comes in configurations containing from one to
twenty\-four 1280\-channel modules in a single system.
The new Mythen2 is available with either 640 or 1280 channel modules, where
single system configurations can have a mix of both types.
.sp
The Mythen firmware has undergone significant evolution.
The current release of \fBspec\fP supports Mythen firmware versions 1.3 through 4.
Firmware revisions have introduced new commands and new syntax for existing commands.
In revision 4, some existing commands have been removed.
All these changes should be handled transparently by \fBspec\fP\(aqs built\-in code.
For the most part, user commands to set parameters or modes that aren\(aqt handled
by the firmware version on the configured Mythen units are silently ignored.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.rs
.sp
Each Mythen unit is configured on the MCA\- and CCD\-type
\fBA\fPquisition screen of the the configuration editor
along the following lines:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
MCA\- and CCD\-Acquisition Type Device Configuration

MCA\-like       DEVICE    ADDR  <>MODE                <>TYPE

 3  YES     host:1031   StdCu          Dectris Mythen (TCP)
.ft P

.RE
.sp
The \fBTYPE\fP can be configured for either UDP or TCP connections.
(Mythen version 1 firmware only recognizes UDP connections.)
The \fBDEVICE\fP name is either a resolvable host name or IP address.
A port number for the socket connection can be specified.
Otherwise, the default port (1030 for UDP, 1031 for TCP) will be used.
.sp
The \fBADDR\fP field can optionally contain the name of the initial
trim or settings file to load.  For firmware below version 2, the names
\fBTrimCr\fP, \fBTrimCu\fP and \fBTrimMo\fP are recognized.
If missing, the \fBTrimCu\fP trim file will be loaded by default.
For firmware version 2, the names
\fBStdCu\fP, \fBStdMo\fP, \fBHgCr\fP, \fBHgCu\fP, \fBFastCu\fP and \fBFastMo\fP
are recognized by the Mythen.
For firmware version 3 and 4, the names can be one of \fBCu\fP, \fBMo\fP, \fBCr\fP or \fBAg\fP.
For firmware version 2 and above,
if no name is given, the existing settings on the Mythen will be used.
Loading the settings file takes time on the Mythen, making
it preferable to leave the \fBADDR\fP field blank.
.sp
Configure only one entry for units with multiple modules.
Individual modules on the units can be addressed with syntax described in the
\fI\%Multiple Modules\fP section below.
.sp
For Mythen firmware 2 and 3,
the optional controller parameters
\fB"inpol"\fP and \fB"outpol"\fP can be assigned through the configuration editor.
Type \fBp\fP from the main screen to bring up the optional parameter screen and
add the parameter names and values to the configuration.
.SH "OPERATION"
.rs
.sp
The Mythen can be started and stopped from \fBspec\fP two
ways:  automatically with the built\-in count functions or by explicit
\fBmca_par("run")\fP commands.
If auto\-run mode is set with
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmca_par("auto_run", 1)\fP
.RE
.sp
the MCA will be started and stopped with the counting functions
used by the standard macros such as \fBct\fP and all the scans.
If soft\-preset mode is also set with
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmca_par("soft_preset", 1)\fP
.RE
.sp
the MCA will programmed with the same
count time as the master timer in count\-to\-time mode.
.sp
For version 4 firmware, if \fB"soft_preset"\fP is not set, the Mythen will
be programmed for a very long count time and halted when the
master timer completes.
For earlier firmware, if \fB"soft_preset"\fP is not set, the Mythen will
be programmed for
the \fB"preset"\fP count time set with \fBmca_par()\fP, which must be nonzero.
With pre\-version 4 firmware, data is lost if an acquisition is halted, so
counting to a definite preset is the only option.
.sp
A gate signal from the master timer or counter can be used to gate the MCA
so that the acquisition interval exactly matches the master.
Enable hardware gating with the \fB"geteen"\fP option to
\fBmca_par()\fP.
.sp
When using \fB"auto_run"\fP mode, only one frame will be acquired.
In order to acquire multiple frames, use
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBmca_par("run")\fP
.RE
.sp
to start acquisition.
With firmware 3 and earlier,
the Mythen can only buffer four data frames,
so it is essential that \fBspec\fP read data as it becomes available.
That is done during the automatic hardware polling built into \fBspec\fP.
It is important not to disable that feature with
\fBspec_par()\fP and not to set too long of a polling interval.
In addition, one must not run commands during multi\-frame acquisition that
will interfere with polling, such as creating a subshell with
\fBunix()\fP.
With version 4 firmware, the Mythen2 can buffer several thousand frames, so
continuous real\-time transfer of the data to \fBspec\fP is not as crucial.
.SH "CORRECTIONS"
.rs
.sp
The Mythen offers three correction capabilities: bad\-channel, flat\-field and rate correction.
Each correction can be configured to be performed within the Mythen
before data is returned,
within \fBspec\fP or not at all.
.sp
With bad\-channel correction, counts in channels marked as bad will be replaced
with the average counts from the next neighbors.
If the correction is turned off, the channel will contain a \-2.
The bad\-channel file is included with the detector as part of the firmware.
.sp
The flat\-field correction, when enabled, is applied to the entire image using
data from a correction file included with the detector.
.sp
The rate correction corrects for dead time at high data rates.
.SH "MULTI\-FRAME DATA"
.rs
.sp
There are two ways for \fBspec\fP to store the Mythen multi\-frame data.
In the first method, \fBspec\fP will allocate enough storage to hold the data
for the number of frames configured.  The data can be retrieved using the
\fB"frame"\fP or \fB"cframe"\fP options to \fBmca_par()\fP.
The \fB"frame"\fP option returns the data as read from the Mythen.
The \fB"cframe"\fP option applies any corrections (flat\-field, bad\-channel, rate)
that have been configured to be done in \fBspec\fP rather than by the Mythen
firmware.
.sp
In the second method for reading data, an appropriately
configured data array is designated
using the \fB"array"\fP option to \fBmca_par()\fP.  The data array should be of type
\fBlong\fP, the number of columns should be equal to the total number of
channels in all the Mythen modules associated with the unit.
The number of rows in the array
should be at least as great as the number of frames set with the
\fB"frames"\fP option.
For example, a data array configured as
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBlong array data[200][1280]\fP
.RE
.sp
would accommodate 200 frames for a 1K single\-module unit.
If using a 6K or 24K Mythen, multiply the 1280 by the number of modules.
With a Mythen2, take into account the total number of 640\- or 1280\-channel modules.
.sp
\fBspec\fP will apply any data corrections that are configured to be performed by \fBspec\fP
to the data that goes into the array.
.sp
The array can also be a shared data array.
\fBspec\fP will automatically tag the array
as \fB"frames"\fP and set the \fBframe_size\fP and
\fBlatest_frame\fP elements of the shared data header
(see \fBspec\fP\(aqs \fI\%arrays\fP help file).
An auxiliary utility such as
\fI\%PyMca\fP can do real\-time
display of the data in the shared array as it arrives.
.sp
Both methods for storing the data may be active at the same time.
.sp
The standard \fBmca_get()\fP function will return
the first frame of multi\-frame data.  Use the \fB"frame"\fP or \fB"cframe"\fP option to \fBmca_par()\fP
to read any single frame.
.sp
For firmware prior to version 4,
high frame rates can be achieved by setting
the \fB"bits"\fP parameter to 4, 8 or 16.
Data will be read in a compressed format and no corrections
will be performed in the Mythen.
However, \fBspec\fP will still do the
flat\-field correction (\fB"autocorrect"\fP), bad\-channel interpolation
(\fB"badchan"\fP) or rate correction (\fB"rate_correct"\fP) if the value
of
the corresponding option has been set to a value of 1 or 2.
.sp
The compressed format is not available in firmware 4, although the \fB"bits"\fP parameter
can still be set to control the dynamic range of the acquisition.
.SH "MULTIPLE MODULES"
.rs
.sp
The Mythen hardware is available in configurations that include more than one
module.
For the original Mythen, each module has 1280 channels.
With the Mythen2, modules can have 1280 or 640 channels.
When reading the data with \fBmca_get()\fP or getting the
bad\-channel or flat\-field arrays with \fBmca_par()\fP,
the default is get all the channels from all the modules
in the returned array.
.sp
The \fBmca_get()\fP and
\fBmca_par()\fP functions work with the default MCA unit.
If there is only one MCA unit configured, that unit is the default.
Otherwise, the \fBmca_sel()\fP function can be used
to select which MCA to use as the default unit.
The \fBmca_spar()\fP and \fBmca_sget()\fP
take an initial argument that specifies a specific MCA unit number,
independent of the default MCA unit number.
.sp
For multiple modules in a given Mythen unit, the
MCA selection syntax for the commands \fBmca_spar()\fP and \fBmca_sget()\fP
is expanded. To select a specific Mythen module,
address arguments may be given as
\fB"0.0"\fP, \fB0.1\fP, \fB0.2\fP, ..., where the first digit
is the MCA unit number from the \fBconfig\fP file,
and the digit right of the decimal point is the
MCA device, where the devices are numbered starting from 0.
For module zero, the argument needs to be passed as a string.
Quote marks are optional for higher numbered modules.
The syntax \fB"0:0"\fP, \fB"0:1"\fP, \fB"0:2"\fP, ..., is also recognized,
where the arguments for each module are strings.
.sp
The syntax for \fBmca_get()\fP and \fBmca_sget()\fP is
.sp
.RS 4m
.nf
\fBmca_get(arr [, roi_beg [, roi_end]])\fP
\fBmca_sget(addr, arr [, roi_beg [, roi_end]])\fP
.fi
.sp
.RE
.sp
where \fBarr\fP is a data array to receive the data, and the optional
\fBroi_beg\fP and \fBroi_end\fP arguments specify start and end channels
in the MCA data.
By default, both functions will return data from
all the modules.  If the option \fBroi_beg\fP and \fBroi_end\fP arguments
are used, they will be with respect to the total channel count from all modules.
However, if a subaddress is used with \fBmca_sget()\fP, only the data for the
specified module will be returned.  The optional \fBroi_beg\fP and \fBroi_end\fP
arguments will be with respect to the data in that module only.
.sp
The subaddress syntax with \fBmca_spar()\fP affects certain of the available commands as follows.
If no subaddress is used,
\fB"flatfield"\fP, \fB"flatfield_norm"\fP, \fB"badchannels"\fP, \fB"frame"\fP and \fB"cframe"\fP
return an array containing channels for all the modules, otherwise just for the
module specified.
For
\fB"send"\fP, \fB"read"\fP and \fB"read_float"\fP, module addressing
will be used if there is a subaddress.
If a subaddress is used with \fB"dump"\fP, information will be displayed only for the module specified.
If no subaddress is used with \fB"npts"\fP, the total number of channels for all modules will be returned,
otherwise just for the module specified.
For
\fB"tau"\fP, \fB"autosettings"\fP, \fB"energy"\fP and \fB"kthresh"\fP, the command will apply
to module zero if no subaddress is given.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.rs
.sp
\fBspec\fP can set all of the Mythen operational parameters using the
\fBmca_par()\fP function, as described in the following section.
The parameters \fB"auto_run"\fP, \fB"soft_preset"\fP,
\fB"preset"\fP, \fB"bits"\fP, \fB"frames"\fP, \fB"delbef"\fP,
\fB"delafter"\fP, \fB"gateen"\fP, \fB"gates"\fP, \fB"trigen"\fP,
\fB"conttrigen"\fP, \fB"threshold"\fP, \fB"inpol"\fP, \fB"outpol"\fP,
\fB"autocorrect"\fP, \fB"badchan"\fP, \fB"rate_correct"\fP,
\fB"kthresh"\fP, \fB"tau"\fP and \fB"verbose"\fP
will be retained in the user state file.
In addition, \fB"inpol"\fP and \fB"outpol"\fP can be set
as optional controller parameters in the hardware configuration file.
Values set in the configuration file will take precedence
over values in the state file.
.sp
Before sending the start command to the MCA,
any parameters that have been updated will be sent to the Mythen.
All parameters will also be updated on the next start command
if there has been a \fB"trimfile"\fP or \fB"settings"\fP command issued.
The \fBmca_par()\fP command \fB"update"\fP can also be used to have the
parameters updated without starting an acquisition.
.sp
More than one client can communicate with a Mythen device at the same time.
Firmware version 3 and later return a command sequence number that allows
\fBspec\fP to detect whether another client has sent a command.
If there is an unexpected change in the sequence number, \fBspec\fP will reprogram
all parameters for the next acquisition.
If the other client\(aqs access was read\-only,
the reprogramming is unnecessary, but there is currently no way to tell whether
the other client changed parameters.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.rs
.sp
When called with the optional argument,
the functions below will set the parameter to the value of the argument.
With no arguments,
the functions will return the current value of the parameter.
If the firmware version allows it, \fBspec\fP will read the parameter value
from the Mythen.
It isn\(aqt possible for \fBspec\fP to read parameter values (with earlier firmware versions)
returned values will be those
previously set using \fBmca_par()\fP during the current session,
or the saved values from the
user\(aqs state file, if not starting fresh.
.sp
Note, \fBspec\fP does not normally send commands to change the parameters
until the Mythen MCA is started,
either using the \fB"run"\fP command or during counting when
\fB"auto_run"\fP is enabled.
However, the \fB"update"\fP command will send values for changed parameters to
the Mythen (available in \fBspec\fP 6.03.02).
Of the following,
the only commands that access the Mythen (besides the obvious
\fB"run"\fP and \fB"halt"\fP) are
\fB"reset"\fP,
\fB"autosettings"\fP,
\fB"trimfile"\fP, \fB"settings"\fP, \fB"send"\fP, \fB"read"\fP, \fB"read_float"\fP
and, of course, \fB"update"\fP.
The commands
\fB"flatfield"\fP, \fB"flatfield_norm"\fP and \fB"badchannels"\fP will
read the associated data from the Mythen if the data has not already been
cached by \fBspec\fP.
.sp
If multiple MCA devices are configured in \fBspec\fP, use the
\fBmca_sel()\fP function to designate the device
to use with the \fBmca_par()\fP and
\fBmca_get()\fP functions, or use the \fBmca_spar()\fP
and \fBmca_sget()\fP forms of the functions.
See the \fI\%mca\fP help file for more information.
.sp
When using the multiple\-module versions, certain
commands below are module specific.
The module can be specified using the \fBmca_spar()\fP
version of the command, as explained in the \fI\%Multiple Modules\fP
section above.
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("update")\fP
\- 
Sends any modified parameters to the Mythen.  Modified parameters
are also sent with the \fB"run"\fP command.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("run")\fP
\- 
Programs the device with updated parameters and starts acquisition.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("halt")\fP
\- 
Halts acquisition.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("preset" [, seconds])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets the preset value used when manually
starting the MCA using the \fB"run"\fP option or when using \fB"auto_run"\fP with
\fB"soft_preset"\fP off with version 3 or earlier firmware.
If the gate is enabled in multi\-frame mode, the preset is ignored by
the Mythen, but if the frame rate is greater than 10 frames per second,
the preset should be set to a value of 0.1 or less so that \fBspec\fP
will use a more robust method for reading data at high frame rates.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("auto_run" [, arg])\fP
\- 
With no arguments, returns nonzero if auto\-run
mode set, otherwise returns zero.
If \fBarg\fP is 1, enables auto\-run mode.
If \fBarg\fP is 0, turns off auto\-run mode.
When auto\-run mode is set the device is
started and stopped with the counting functions \fBtcount()\fP,
\fBmcount()\fP, etc.
When not set, the counting functions are ignored, but
the device can be controlled with the \fB"run"\fP
and \fB"halt"\fP options.
In addition, the device can be halted with the
\fBstop()\fP function and will be halted with \fB^C\fP.
Auto\-run mode is off by default for the Mythen.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("soft_preset" [, arg])\fP
\- 
With no arguments,
returns nonzero if soft\-preset mode is set,
otherwise returns zero.
If \fBarg\fP is 1, enables soft\-preset mode.
If \fBarg\fP is 0, turns off soft\-preset mode.
When set, and if auto\-run mode is enabled (see above),
the Mythen is programmed to count for the time preset given
as an argument to the \fBtcount()\fP function.
The \fBwait()\fP function will wait until both the
timer and the Mythen have counted to their respective presets.
When soft\-preset mode is not set, but auto\-run mode is,
the Mythen2 with version 4 firmware is programmed for continuous data acquisition and will
be stopped when the timer\(aqs preset is reached.
Mythen with version 3 and lower firmware will be programmed with the preset time set
with the \fB"preset"\fP option.
When counting to monitor (using \fBmcount()\fP) rather than to time with soft\-preset active,
the Mythen is programmed using the same rules as when soft\-preset is off.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("npts"|"group_size")\fP
\- 
Returns the total number of channels.
Use a subaddress with \fBmca_spar()\fP to read the number of
channels in a specific module.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("bits" [, value])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets the number of bits per channel
for the Mythen to use while acquiring data.
Fewer bits allow for slightly faster frame rates in multi\-frame mode.
Valid values are 4, 8, 16 and 24.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("frames" [, number])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets the number of frames to acquire when using a manual start.
When using \fB"auto_run"\fP mode,
where the MCA is started and stopped with the
master timer, only one frame will be acquired.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("latest_frame")\fP
\- 
Returns the frame number of the most recently acquired frame.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("trimfile" [, name])\fP
\- 
Returns the name of the current trim file,
or loads the specified trim file.
The trim file contains all the initialization parameters
for the MCA and is located with the MCA firmware.
Each trim file has an associated flat\-field file.
The flat\-field data will be read and stored by \fBspec\fP
to be used for the optional flat\-field correction operation.
(Deprecated with version 2 firmware.
Not available with firmware 4.)
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("autosettings" [, threshold])\fP
\- 
Tells the Mythen to load suitable settings corresponding to the value
of \fBthreshold\fP. Units are keV.
If the optional argument is missing,
the value set via the \fB"threshold"\fP command is used.
If that value is unset, uses the threshold value initially read
from the Mythen.
For multiple module systems, the module number needs to be specified
as described above.
(Only for version 2 or 3 firmware.)
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("settings" [, name])\fP
\- 
Without the optional argument, returns the name of the
current settings designation.
Otherwise, sends the Mythen the command to load the settings
associated with \fBname\fP. (Requires version 2 or later firmware.)
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("energy" [, value])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets the X\-ray energy in keV.
For multiple module systems, the value will be for module zero, unless
a different module number is specified using \fBmca_spar(0)\fP with a
subaddress.
(Only for version 3 and later firmware.)
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("kthresh"|"threshold" [, value])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets the threshold energy in keV.
For multiple module systems, the value will be for module zero, unless
a different module number is specified using \fBmca_spar(0)\fP with a
subaddress.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("delbef" [, seconds])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets the delay between trigger and the first measurement.
.HP 5m

\fBmca_par("trigen" [, 0|1])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets triggered\-measurement mode
(0 for disabled and 1 for enabled).
A trigger starts the entire multi\-frame acquisition or
a separate trigger is needed for each frame, depending on
the value of the continuous\-trigger\-enable parameter, \fB"conttrigen"\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("conttrigen" [, 0|1])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets repeated

to receive multi\-frame data.
The array name can be passed as the array variable or as a string.
The array should be type
\fBlong\fP, the number of columns should be 1280 times the number of modules for
6K and 24K systems, and the number of rows
should be at least as great as the number of frames.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("autocorrect" [, 0|1|2])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets the mode where data placed directly into the
designated data array has the flat\-field correction applied.
A zero disables autocorrection, while nonzero enables the mode.
With version 2 firmware and later, the correction is
performed within the Mythen if the value is one and the data
is not being read using the \fBraw\fP method.
Otherwise,
the correction
is performed within \fBspec\fP.
.HP 5m

\fBmca_par("flatfield_norm")\fP
\- 
Returns a float data array containing
the normalized flat\-field data
for all channels or for one module on a multi\-module system if
specified with an \fBmca_spar()\fP subaddress.
The flat\-field data is used when \fB"autocorrect"\fP mode is enabled.
.HP 5m

Returns or sets rate\-correction mode.
A value of zero disables rate\-correction.  A value of one sets the
correction to be done within the Mythen (or in \fBspec\fP if data is
being read using the \fBraw\fP method).
A value of two sets the correction to be done in \fBspec\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("tau" [, value])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets the dead\-time constant for rate correction.
Units are nanoseconds.  (Requires version 2 firmware.)
For multiple module systems, the value will be for module zero, unless
a different module number is specified using \fBmca_spar(0)\fP with a
subaddress.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("verbose", [0|1])\fP
\- 
Returns or sets the verbose flag.
When set, \fBspec\fP will display an updated frame count
when acquiring multiple frames.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("reset")\fP
\- 
Sends the command to reset the Mythen to the default settings.
(Requires version 2 firmware.)
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("dump")\fP
\- 
Displays the current values of the Mythen parameters for all modules
for all modules or for just one module on a multi\-module system if
specified with an \fBmca_spar()\fP subaddress.
