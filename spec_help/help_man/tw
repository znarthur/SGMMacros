.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.rs
.sp
\fBtw  motor [motor2 ...] delta [delta2 ...] [ctime]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBtw\fP macro is used to interactively move one or more
motors in small increments.
Each time you hit return the motor or motors specified in the arguments
will be moved the amount given by the corresponding
\fBdelta\fP parameters.
The delta parameters can be of different signs for the different
motors.
You can change directions for all the motors by typing
\fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP (or \fBp\fP or \fBn\fP) before hitting return.
You can also enter a new (signed) delta
for the first motor for subsequent moves.
The delta for the other motors will be changed proportionally.
.sp
If the optional \fBctime\fP parameter is given, the results of counting for the
specified time will be displayed after each move.
If the settling\-time parameter \fB_sleep\fP (set by the
\fBsetscans\fP macro) is nonzero, counting will be delayed by the specified time.
.sp
If the global variable \fBTW_BEEP\fP is nonzero,
the macro will beep when the moving and counting is finished
for each iteration.  By default, beeping is off.
.sp
If the global variable \fBTW_UPDATE\fP is nonzero,
the moving and counting values will be updated on the screen
using the value of the standard \fBUPDATE\fP variable
as the delay between each update.
By default, the updated mode is enabled.
