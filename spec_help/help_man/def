.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The command \fBdef\fP defines a macro named \fBmacname\fP to be
\fBstring_constant\fP. Each time \fBmacname\fP occurs on input,
it will be replaced by \fBstring_constant\fP.
The definition is made at the time the command is first read,
so the macro can be used later
in the same statement block in which it is defined and can be redefined
within the same statement block.
.sp
The command \fBrdef\fP is similar to \fBdef\fP,
but the macro assignment is not made until
the encompassing statements are parsed and executed.  Also, although
\fBexpression\fP is usually a string constant, it needn\(aqt be.
