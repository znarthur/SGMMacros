.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
These notes summarize the modifications made for \fBspec\fP release 2.11,
as finalized on February 6, 1989.
.SH "CHANGES"
.rs
.sp
If the command file
\fB/usr/lib/spec.d/site.mac\fP
exists,
it will be read each time any user runs \fBspec\fP.
Site administrators are encouraged to put site\-specific commands
in this file, for example, commands to assign
synchrotron\-beamline monochromator parameters.
.sp
The
\fBascan\fP
and
\fBa2scan\fP
macros now include the values of
\fBH\fP,
\fBK\fP
and
\fBL\fP
at each data point in the data file.
.sp
In the prescan limit checking for the various
\fBhkl\fP
scans,
a check for motor\-limit problems at the last point of the scan
has been added before the limit checking at the rest of the points
in the scan.
Thus, a limit problem that occurs at the extreme points in
\fBH\fP,
\fBK\fP
and
\fBL\fP
will be caught earlier.
.sp
New scan macros
\fBa3scan\fP
and
\fBd3scan\fP
are included for scanning three
motors at a time.
.sp
A new scan macro
\fBhklmesh\fP
is provided that does a mesh scan of any
two of
\fBH\fP,
\fBK\fP
and
\fBL\fP.
.sp
The
\fBscan_on\fP
macro that restarts aborted scans
now also works with mesh scans.
.sp
A
\fBsetplot\fP
macro is now included that lets you configure
the output generated
at the conclusion of a scan.
You can choose from several combinations of printer and screen output.
.sp
The
\fBdo\fP
and
\fBqdo\fP
macros have been modified to look for command files
in a directory given by the global variable
\fBDO_DIR\fP
if they can\(aqt
be found in the current directory.
.sp
A new macro
\fBscan_tail\fP,
defined by default as
\fB_tail\fP,
is called
at the end of each scan.
This construction is similar to the
\fBscan_head\fP
and
\fBscan_loop\fP
macros
already in place and is related to the
\fBsetplot\fP
macro described above.
.sp
New macros for the folks at X\-20 NSLS related to setting the X\-ray
beam energy are included in the standard distribution.
These macros are
\fBset_E\fP,
\fBget_E\fP,
\fBmove_E\fP
and
\fBEscan\fP.
.sp
The
\fBconfig\fP
macro now does a
\fBwaitall\fP
and a
\fBsync\fP
before
invoking the
\fBedconf\fP
program.
.sp
The CAMAC driver for the VENIX system on the AT computers
has been changed to solve
a problem with losing LAM interrupts that come in during servicing
of a prior LAM interrupt.
The bug would manifest itself with \fBspec\fP being hung and DSP 6001
LAM lights being
lit.
(Affected sites should be sure to install the new driver.)
(The problem does not occur on PDP systems.)
.sp
For folks running \fBspec\fP using VENIX on AT clones, \fBspec\fP is now
compiled using the
large\-model compiler.
This gives
a larger memory arena than otherwise available.
The added memory comes at a slight loss of
execution speed, though.
(The regular\-model version is still available.)
.sp
\fBspec\fP now allows you to use more than one kind of motor controller
at a time.
(This feature entailed revising much motor\-related code \- please
inform CSS if you notice any new bug manifestations.)
.sp
The
\fBedconf\fP
program (invoked by the
\fBconfig\fP
macro) has undergone
some changes.
A third screen is used to configure the device names.
The order of the screens is changed so that the motor
screen appears first.
A new parameter for each motor indicates the type of controller
to be used for that motor.
.sp
A presence check is now performed on all types of motor controllers,
not just on the E500.
The check is performed with the
\fBreconfig\fP
command now, rather than
with the
\fBsync\fP
command.
When a controller fails the presence test, the associated motors are
marked as
\fBunusable\fP.
.sp
The
\fB"clearing remaining steps"\fP
message that occurred on
\fB^C\fP
aborts
of E500 motors has been eliminated from normal operation.
The message will appear when hardware debugging is turned on, though.
.sp
A bug with using the
\fBmcount()\fP
function (counting to monitor) with
the RTC\-018 controller has been fixed.
Previously the monitor counts
would be off by a factor of 64.
.sp
The first draft of general serial device routines,
\fBser_get()\fP
and
\fBser_put()\fP
is now available.
See the
\fBserial\fP
help file
for more information.
.sp
A bug where \fBspec\fP tended to dump core after you typed three
\fB^C\fP\(aqs
to
stop motors and
got the message
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBGiving up on waiting.\fP
.sp
\fBIf motor control is hung, type \(gasync\(aq.\fP
.RE
.sp
is fixed.
.sp
A bug where \fBspec\fP would screw up if you had more than nine
arguments in a macro has been
fixed.
.sp
A bug where macro definitions very close to the maximum
length caused \fBspec\fP to screw up badly has been fixed.
.sp
To aid in debugging and testing new versions of \fBspec\fP, a
new command line argument,
.BI \-D " specdir"
is available.
It selects
the name of the
auxiliary file directory to be used instead of the compiled in
directory, normally
\fB/usr/lib/spec.d\fP.
It is also possible to change the compiled in directory
name when remaking \fBspec\fP
on site.
See the comments at the top of the file
\fBu_hook.c\fP
for an explanation
of how.
.sp
There is an
\fBawk\fP
script,
\fBaux/show.awk\fP
in the distribution directory
that can be used with \fBC\-PLOT\fP to produce summary plots of scans,
twelve per page.
The file contains comments explaining its usage.
.sp
The scripts to install kernel drivers,
\fBinstall_dsp\fP
and
\fBinstall_386\fP,
now take several command\-line options.
See the
\fBREADME\fP
file in the
\fBcamac\fP
subdirectory of the distribution for details.
