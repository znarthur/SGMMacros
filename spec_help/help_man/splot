.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
(This document describes \fBsplot\fP the macro, not \fBsplot\fP the Python
utility.)
.sp
The \fBsplot\fP macro produces a screen plot of the current data.
The macro has a number of configurable parameters, most set
using the \fBsetplot\fP macro.
.sp
With no arguments, \fBsplot\fP plots the \fBSCAN_D\fP array using
the counters specified in the \fBPLOT_SEL[]\fP array (which is
configured with either the \fBplotselect\fP macro or the \fBcounters\fP
macro) versus the scan independent variable in column 0 of
the \fBSCAN_D\fP array.
The first through last data point of the most recent
scan (as contained in the \fBLDT\fP global variable) are plotted.
.sp
A single argument \fBy\-col\fP (that is not an array name)
can specify which counters in \fBSCAN_D\fP to plot
for the \fBy\fP\-axis.
The arguments can be counter numbers or counter mnemonics.
The macros will automatically map the counters to the correct
column in the \fBSCAN_D\fP array.
If more than one counter is to be plotted,
the counter names or numbers must be in one string.
Individual counters can be separated by commas as in \fBdet,c3,c4\fP or a
range of counters can given as \fB3:6\fP, which would plot counters 3 through 6.
.sp
A column for the \fBx\fP\-axis can be also specified as an additional argument \fBx\-col\fP prior
to the \fBy\-col\fP argument.  The value can be given as column number in \fBSCAN_D\fP,
motor mnemonic of any motor
included in the scan or \fBH\fP, \fBK\fP or \fBL\fP for reciprocal space scans or motor scans
that involve geometry motors.
.sp
An optional \fBnum\-pts\fP third argument specifies the points in the array to be plotted, using
conventional \fBspec\fP data\-array syntax.  For example, \fB30\fP or \fB:30\fP
would indicate the first point through the 30th point.  The parameter \fB20:80\fP would plot
points 20 through 80.  An argument \fB\-50:\-1\fP or \fB\-50:\fP would plot the last 50 points of the array.
.sp
If the first argument \fBarray\fP is the name of an array and with no additional arguments, \fBsplot\fP
will plot the last column versus the first column using all the rows.
Additional arguments specify the column for \fBx\fP with \fBx\-col\fP, the column for \fBy\fP
with \fBy\-col\fP, then
the number of points (or rows) with \fBnum\-pts\fP.
As with plotting \fBSCAN_D\fP, the arguments for \fBy\-col\fP
and \fBnum\-pts\fP use \fBspec\fP\(aqs data array syntax.
However, unlike the case for
plotting \fBSCAN_D\fP, the \fBx\-col\fP value must be specified if there is a \fBy\-col\fP argument.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.rs
.sp
In the following examples, \fBSCAN_D\fP contains data from a \fBth2th\fP scan
on a four\-circle instrument.
.sp
\fBsplot\fP
.sp
.RS 4m
Plots the scan data in \fBSCAN_D\fP.  The
counters selected via \fBplotselect\fP are plotted
versus the primary scan independent variable in column 0,
usually a motor position.
.RE
.sp
\fBsplot  det\fP
.sp
.RS 4m
As above, but plots only the counter channel \fBdet\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fBsplot  det,c2\fP
.sp
.RS 4m
As above, but plots \fBdet\fP and \fBc2\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fBsplot  th   det\fP
.sp
.RS 4m
Plots \fBdet\fP versus the motor \fBth\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fBsplot  H  det  10:20\fP
.sp
.RS 4m
Plots \fBdet\fP versus reciprocal coordinate \fBH\fP, but only
points 10 through 20.
.RE
.sp
\fBsplot data\fP
.sp
.RS 4m
Plots the last column of the array \fBdata\fP versus the first column.
.RE
.sp
\fBsplot data 0 1:4\fP
.sp
.RS 4m
Plots columns 1 through 4 of \fBdata\fP versus the first column.
.RE
.SH "GLOBAL VARIABLES"
.rs
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBSCAN_D[][]\fP
\- 
Shared data array declared as:
.sp
.RS 5m
.RS 4m
SHARED_SCAN_D array SCAN_D[\fBrows\fP][\fBcols\fP]
.RE
.sp
where the number of \fBrows\fP corresponds to the number of points.
Initially, \fBrows\fP is set to 4096, but the macros automatically
increase the size as needed.  The number of \fBcols\fP is set for
each scan to accommodate all the configured counters and all the
motors in the scan.  If the scan involves motors associated with
the diffractometer reciprocal space calculations, \fBH\fP, \fBK\fP and
\fBL\fP are also saved for each scan point.
.sp
\fBSHARED_SCAN_D\fP is a macro defined as \fBshared\fP, by default.
The \fBSCAN_D\fP
array needs to be a shared\-data array for the external \fBsplot\fP
utility to have access to the data if \fBspec\fP is not running in
server mode.
.RE
.HP 5m
."
\fBSCAN_COLS[]\fP
\- 
An associative array containging string labels for each column in \fBSCAN_D\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBPLOT_MOTS\fP
\- 
The number of independent variables (motors) in \fBSCAN_D\fP columns.
.HP 5m
."
\fBPLOT_NUM\fP
\- 
The number of dependent variables (counters) in \fBSCAN_D\fP columns.
.HP 5m
."
\fBPLOT_SEL[]\fP
\- 
An associative array containing the counter mnemonics for
the columns user to be plotted.
.HP 5m
."
\fBLDT\fP
\- 
The row number in \fBSCAN_D\fP of the most recently added data point.
