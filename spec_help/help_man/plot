.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.rs
.sp
\fBplot [data_group] [x_element] [y_element]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBplot\fP macro is called at the end of each scan
in order to plot the data.  You should use the
\fBsetplot\fP macro to select whether a screen plot, a simple printer plot or both
are produced by \fBplot\fP.
.SH "DEFINITION"
.rs
.sp
If both end\-of\-scan screen plots and lp plots are selected,
\fBplot\fP is defined something like:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
def plot \(aq
   if (BG) {do_bg} # calculate linear background
   splot \e$*       # draw screen plot
   onp; offt       # turn on printer, off tty
   lp_plot \e$*     # draw lp plot
   plot_res \e$*    # print scan results
   ont; offp       # turn on tty, off printer
\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
If neither or just one type of plot is selected,
the \fBplot\fP macro is redefined accordingly.
If no plots are selected, the scan results are still printed
on the screen and printer.
.SH "GLOBALS"
.rs
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBBG\fP
\- 
global variable holding a flag that if set, indicates
to use the background\-subtracted data in the analysis results and
plots produced by the \fBplot\fP macro.
It is important to make sure the
\fBdo_bg\fP macro is called to calculate the background\-subtracted data before
using macros such as \fBpl_FWHM\fP that look at the value of
\fBBG\fP to determine which data group to analyze.
The various standard definitions for the \fBplot\fP macro will call
\fBdo_bg\fP when appropriate.

."
\fBdo_bg\fP
\- 
calculates a linear background based on the scan endpoints, subtracts the
background from the scan (in data group 0) and places the results in
data group 1.
.HP 5m
."
\fBplot_res\fP
\- 
prints results of simple scan analysis including peak value,
full\-width at half max, integrated intensity, etc.
