.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The PCA II and PCA\-3 are ISA (PC card) multichannel analyzers.
The PCA Multiport is a standalone MCA that \fBspec\fP currently supports
using GPIB.
The PCA\-3 and PCA Multiport both support counting to
live\-time and real\-time presets and both return dead\-time information.
The PCA II only supports presets and dead\-time corrections when used
in conjunction with a CSS provided driver, which is only available
on selected PC UNIX platforms.
Otherwise, the PCA II can be used in user\-level I/O mode, with the
timing performed by some other hardware timer or the software clock.
.sp
The PCA\-3 and PCA Multiport come with 16384 channels, while the PCA II
only supports up to 8192 channels.
When acquiring data, the channels can be partitioned into groups of
256, 512, 1024, ... channels up to a single group that contains
all the channels.
Thus, the PCA\-3 and PCA Multiport allows a maximum of 64 groups
of 256 channels, 32 groups of 512 channels, etc.
The maximum number of groups on the PCA II depends on the amount of
memory installed on the board.

The first entry selects the PCA II in user\-level polled mode.
The second entry uses interrupt\-driven mode which requires a kernel
driver.
See the
\fBdrivers/README\fP file in the \fBspec\fP distribution for information
on installing the driver.
The third entry is for the PCA\-3 device.
The fourth entry is for the GPIB PCA Multiport.
.sp
If using the interrupt\-driven mode with the PCA II, note the following:
Apparently, the PCA II doesn\(aqt trigger an interrupt on some PC mother boards.
This problem can be fixed by changing the value
of the resistor labeled R12 on the "PCA2 Memory Card" circuit diagram.
This resistor is located near the lower left corner
of the main board when viewed from the component side with
the connector fingers pointing down and the input BNC to the right.
R12 is about a centimeter down and to the left of the U26 IC.
The circuit diagram indicates the resistor\(aqs value is 2K,
however the boards seem
to be shipped with a 1K resistor (brown\-black\-red stripes).
Soldering a second 1K resistor alongside R12 and in parallel electrically
will lower the resistance to 0.5K, which seems to work.
(This modification was suggested by the manufacturer.)
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.rs
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_get(arr)\fP or \fBmca_get(g, e)\fP
\- 
Gets data from the currently selected MCA\-type device, and transfers it to
the array \fBarr\fP or to element \fBe\fP of data group
\fBg\fP. Use of arrays rather than data groups is recommended.
The native data type is \fBulong\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("disable", arg)\fP
\- 
If \fBarg\fP is 1, prevents the PCA from being started and stopped by the
standard counting functions \fBtcount()\fP and \fBmcount()\fP. If
\fBarg\fP is 0,
the PCA will be started and stopped with the standard counting
functions (which is the default behavior).
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("clear")\fP
\- 
Clears the channels of the current group.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("run")\fP
\- 
Programs the board with the current parameters and starts acquisition.
For the PCA\-3 and Multiport, acquisition time will be to the selected
preset in real time or live time in PHA mode or the selected
preset in number of passes in MCS mode.  Note that the
\fBtcount()\fP and \fBmcount()\fP functions,
as used in the various counting macros, will also start
PCA acquisition, however the PCA will free run until
the count time passed to those functions has expired.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("halt")\fP
\- 
Stops acquisition.
Note that the PCA will also be halted when the \fBtcount()\fP and
\fBmcount()\fP functions (as used in the various counting macros)
complete their count intervals or are aborted.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("group_size")\fP
\- 
Returns the current group size.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("group_size", size)\fP
\- 
Sets the group size to \fBsize\fP. Legal values
are 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 and 16384.
On the PCA II, values above 1024 may not be legal
if insufficient memory is installed on the board.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("select_group")\fP
\- 
Returns the currently active group.  Groups are numbered starting at zero.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("select_group", group)\fP
\- 
Set the active group to \fBgroup\fP.
The maximum number of groups equals the number
of channels divided by the group size.
If the \fBgroup\fP passed to the function is greater
than the maximum number of groups, the current group selected
is \fBgroup\fP modulus the maximum number of groups.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("pha")\fP
\- 
Selects pulse\-height analysis mode.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("gain")\fP
\- 
Returns the current gain value used in pulse\-height analysis mode.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("gain", value)\fP
\- 
Sets the pulse\-height analysis gain to \fBvalue\fP.
Legal values are 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 and 8192.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("offset")\fP
\- 
Returns the current digital conversion offset used
in pulse\-height analysis mode.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("offset", value)\fP
\- 
Sets the pulse\-height analysis digital conversion offset to
\fBvalue\fP. Legal values are multiples of 256 from 0 to 7936.
An offset value shifts the channel contents.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("mcs")\fP
\- 
Selects multichannel scaling mode.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("dwell")\fP
\- 
Returns the current multichannel scaling dwell time.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("dwell", value)\fP
\- 
Set the multichannel scaling dwell time.  Allowed values are numbers
between 1e\-6 and 60 seconds with mantissa of 1, 2, 4 or 8.
A value of \-1 selects external dwell.
If \fBvalue\fP isn\(aqt an allowed value,
it is rounded to the nearest allowed value.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("mode")\fP
\- 
Returns two if the PCA is in PHA live\-time mode,
one if the PCA is in PHA real\-time mode and zero if the PCA is in MCS mode.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmca_par("readone", channel)\fP
\- 
Returns the contents of channel number \fBchannel\fP.
The channel number is with respect to the current group.

Sets channel \fB#\fP to
\fBvalue\fP. The channel number is with respect to the current group.

The following \fBmca_par()\fP functions are valid
for the PCA\-3 and PCA Multiport devices, but are
only valid for the PCA II when the board is used
with the interrupt\-driven driver.
