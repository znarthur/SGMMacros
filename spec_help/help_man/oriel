.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The Oriel 18092 Encoder Mike Controller
is supported by \fBspec\fP on both RS\-232C and GPIB interfaces.
.sp
The controller is selected in the \fBconfig\fP file as
.sp
.RS 4m
.nf
\fBRS_18092 = device_name baud_rate number_of_motors\fP
\fBGP_18092 = gpib_address number_of_motors\fP

depending on the interface being used.
.sp
When running the configuration editor, switch to the
device configuration screen to select the appropriate interface.
On the motor screen, select the
\fB18092\fP controller type for each motor to be controlled.
.sp
By default, motors are automatically
assigned to the controller channels in the same order
they appear on the motor screen.
If there is more than one controller, the channels are assigned
to the controllers in the order in which the controllers
appear on the motor device screen.
However, for the Oriel 18092 motor controller,
controller\-unit and motor\-channel numbers can
be assigned in arbitrary order on the second line of the
motor configuration screen.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.rs
.sp
\fBspec\fP allows a number of additional parameters to
be set in the configuration file and by the
\fBmotor_par()\fP function for this controller.
Use the configuration editor to establish the long\-term values of
the parameters in the configuration file.
Use \fBmotor_par()\fP to make changes to the parameters
that only are in effect during
a particular \fBspec\fP session.
To set the parameters from the configuration editor, use the \fBm\fP
command from the main motor screen to access the optional\-parameter screens.
.sp
The following parameters are associated with DC motor operation.
The two\-letter command sent to the motor controller associated
with each parameter is given in parenthesis.
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "dc_gain" [, value])\fP
\- 
If \fBvalue\fP is given, sets the gain (or
derivative gain), otherwise returns the current value.
The factory default value is 3000.
(\fB"SG"\fP) (Note, the Oriel manual incorrectly
indicates this parameter is set with "SD".)
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "dc_integration_constant" [, value])\fP
\- 
If \fBvalue\fP is given, sets the
integral gain, otherwise returns the current value.
The factory default value is 10. (\fB"SI"\fP)
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "dc_integration_limit" [, value])\fP
\- 
If \fBvalue\fP is given, sets the
integration limit, otherwise returns the current value.
The factory default value is 200. (\fB"IL"\fP)
.RE
.sp
Another \fBmotor_par()\fP parameter is:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "slop" [, value])\fP
\- 
If \fBvalue\fP is given,
sets a threshold value in steps, below which \fBspec\fP
suppresses position discrepancy messages
when \fBspec\fP and the motor controller disagree about motor position,
otherwise returns the current value.

.sp
With the GPIB interface on the Oriel 18092,
it is apparently necessary for an application to insert delays
before sending commands and reading back responses.
The following two parameters allow the length of the delay to be tuned.
These two parameters cannot be set in the configuration file.
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "wdelay" [, value])\fP
\- 
If \fBvalue\fP is given, sets the
delay before writing a command over the GPIB interface to
\fBvalue\fP microseconds, otherwise returns the current value.
The default value is 75000 (0.075 usec).
.RE
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "rdelay" [, value])\fP
\- 
If \fBvalue\fP is given, sets the
delay before reading a response over the GPIB interface to
\fBvalue\fP microseconds, otherwise returns the current value.
The default value is 75000 (0.075 usec).
.RE
.SH "COMMAND PASS THROUGH"
.rs
.sp
Command pass through is available using the following:
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "send", cmd)\fP
\- 
Sends the string \fBcmd\fP
to the Oriel 18092 channel associated with \fBmotor\fP.
For example, set \fBcmd\fP to \fB"SB1,3,8"\fP to set output bits 1, 3 and 8.
.HP 5m
."
\fBmotor_par(motor, "read", cmd)\fP
\- 
Sends the string \fBcmd\fP to the Oriel 18092 channel associated with
\fBmotor\fP, as above, and returns a string containing the response.
.RE
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.rs
.sp
The Oriel 18092 motor controller only allows
its internal position registers to be set to zero.
Thus the \fBchg_dial()\fP function (used by the \fBset_dial\fP macro)
will not accept nonzero position arguments.
Similarly, if there is a
motor position discrepancy between \fBspec\fP and the controller, if you choose
to change the controller register position to agree with \fBspec\fP
and if the \fBspec\fP dial position is not zero,
the \fBspec\fP dial position will instead be changed to agree with the
controller, and the the \fBspec\fP
\fBoffset\fP parameter will be changed
to keep the same \fBspec\fP user\-units position.
.SH "VERSION"
.rs
.sp
The above description describes the Oriel 18092 firmware version 1.0d.
