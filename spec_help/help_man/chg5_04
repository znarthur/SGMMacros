.SH "January 21, 2004 \- RELEASE 5.04.04\-10"
.rs
.SH "Workaround For New Focus 8750/53 Firmware Bug"
.sp
A workaround for a bug in the recent
firmware for the New Focus 8750/53 motor controllers that
prevented the existing \fBspec\fP code
from working with these controllers is included in this \fBspec\fP release.
Motor controller firmware release 1.0.13 did not have the bug.
Firmware releases 1.3.1 and 1.5.3 are known to have the bug, and
\fBspec\fP assumes all releases in between do, too.
.SH "January 15, 2004 \- RELEASE 5.04.04\-9"
.rs
.SH "Fix For New Unit/Module/Channel Motor Numbering"
.sp
The optional module numbering for motors that was introduced in
release 5.04.03\-2 didn\(aqt allow
motors to have the same unit and channel numbers but
different module (crate) numbers.
That problem is now fixed.
.SH "\fBunix()\fP Will Strip Initial Null Bytes From Output"
.sp
When the
\fBunix()\fP
function is used to assign the output from the command given by the
first argument into the string variable given by the
second argument, initial null bytes in
the command output will now be stripped away.
.SH "Support For MEN M97 Counter/Timer Modules"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports the MEN Mikro Electronik GmbH M\-Bus model
M97 timer/counters.
The current support is based on the M97 module being installed
in an MEN A201S 6U VMEbus Carrier Board.
.SH "January 12, 2004 \- RELEASE 5.04.04\-8"
.rs
.SH "Support For MEN M8 VME To GPIB Controller"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports the MEN Mikro Electronik GmbH M\-Bus model
M8 GPIB controller.
The current support is based on the M8 module being installed
in an MEN A201S 6U VMEbus Carrier Board.
Multiple M8 controllers can be used.
.SH "January 9, 2004 \- RELEASE 5.04.04\-7"
.rs
.SH "Update For Struck SIS3820 Multi\-Channel Scaler Update"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now works with updated firmware version 1.02 for the
Struck
SIS3820 multichannel
scaler.
These updated modules now have all the functionality
required to use them as
a timer/counters with \fBspec\fP.
Firmware 1.01 is no longer supported.
\fBspec\fP now automatically routes the internal 50 MHz time base to channel
zero, if that channel is configured as the time base.
Also, \fBspec\fP now keeps track of unlimited overflows in all channels
and will restart the timer as necessary
to accommodate arbitrarily long count times, whether counting to time
or to monitor counts.
.SH "More Robust Code For Tsuji PM16C Over Ethernet"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now includes code to retry read commands when using the Tsuji
PM16C motor controllers over the Ethernet interface.
\fBspec\fP will resend commands to read values up to four times
if there are timeouts when waiting for a response from the
motor controller.
In addition the Ethernet timeout value has been reduced from
five to two seconds.
The reason for the change is due to reported timeouts when the controller
is used on a busy network.
.SH "Another Fix For Mclennan PM608 Motor Controllers"
.sp
A bug, where the Mclennan PM608
motor positions were not
tested for
synchronization with positions stored on the computer,
has been fixed.
(The fix in release 5.04.04\-2 was not completely effective.)
.SH "January 7, 2004 \- RELEASE 5.04.04\-6"
.rs
.SH "Fix For Recently Introduced CAMAC SMC Bug"
.sp
A bug (introduced in release
5.02.02\-7
and associated with changes
made to accommodate server mode), that caused bogus motor positions
to be returned for the CAMAC Joerger
SMC motor controllers when used without associated counters,
has been fixed.
.SH "January 7, 2004 \- RELEASE 5.04.04\-5"
.rs
.SH "Real Fix For Catching Signals In Server Mode"
.sp
A bug in server mode only, where \fBspec\fP
inappropriately blocked several signals
(including the hang\-up signal
generated when a window running
\fBspec\fP is closed),
and which was reported to be fixed in release 5.04.04\-2, but wasn\(aqt,
is now really fixed.
.SH "January 6, 2004 \- RELEASE 5.04.04\-4"
.rs
.SH "Fix For Struck SIS1100/3100 VME Controller"
.sp
A bug, where \fBspec\fP would crash after repeated
\fBreconfig\fP
commands with the message
\fB"No more room for VME memory maps"\fP
when using the Struck SIS1100/3100 VME Controller,
has been fixed.
.SH "January 5, 2004 \- RELEASE 5.04.04\-3"
.rs
.SH "\fB\(dqpgm\(dq\fP Format Now Accepts 16\-Bit Data"
.sp
The
\fB"pgm"\fP
file format for the
\fBfmt_write()\fP
and
\fBfmt_read()\fP
functions now supports 16\-bit data, in addition to the existing
support for 8\-bit data.
.SH "Update to PC\-DIG Frame Grabber Support"
.sp
The support for the
Coreco Imaging (formerly ITI) PC\-DIG frame grabber has been revised.
It is no longer necessary to configure a camera type in the
\fBADDR\fP
field of the configuration editor.
\fBspec\fP will now obtain the needed configuration parameters from the
initialized
\fBitifg\fP
driver module.
.SH "January 4, 2004 \- RELEASE 5.04.04\-2"
.rs
.SH "Fix For Catching Signals In Server Mode"
.sp
A bug in server mode only, where \fBspec\fP
inappropriately blocked several signals
(including the hang\-up signal
generated when a window running
\fBspec\fP is closed),
has been fixed.
.SH "Language Dependence Removed For External Shared Arrays On \fBLinux\fP"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now uses a different method for finding available existing shared
arrays (needed for the
\fBextern shared\fP
usage)
that doesn\(aqt depend on the locale\-dependent output of the
\fBipcs\fP
command.
The new method is only available on
\fBLinux\fP
platforms, however.
.sp
When using utilities built with prior versions of the
\fBsps\fP
shared\-array library or when running on
non\-\fBLinux\fP
platforms, the language locale can be set to English for a single
command as follows:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
shell> LANG=en onze &
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
The above starts the
\fBonze\fP
2D\-image display utility as a background process with the
\fBLANG\fP
environment variable set to English.
.SH "Homing Implemented For IMS MDrive Motor Controllers"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now implements home searches for the IMS
MDrive motor controllers.
\fBspec\fP uses MDrive input pin three as the default home input.
.SH "Support For Tsuji CT16\-01B Counter/Timer"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports the Tsuji Electronics Model CT16\-01B 16\-channel
counter/timer over GPIB and RS\-232C interfaces.
.SH "Support For Hasylab MCA 8701 VME Module"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports the Hasylab home\-grown VME MCA known as model 8701.
.SH "Fix For Mclennan PM608 Motor Controllers"
.sp
A bug, where only the first channel of each Mclennan PM608
motor controller was
tested for
synchronization with positions stored on the computer,
has been fixed.
.SH "Fix For Amptek Pocket MCA"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now automatically disables the security
locking feature of the Amptek
\fB"Pocket"\fP
MCA 8000/8000A on startup.
Otherwise, if the security locking had been turned on elsewhere,
\fBspec\fP would be unable to modify the device parameters or control the
device.
.SH "November 20, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.04.04\-1"
.rs
.SH "Tilde Expansion Now A Built\-In Feature"
.sp
The tilde expansion feature for path names, where
\fB~\fP
is expanded to the \fBspec\fP user\(aqs home directory path, and
\fB~name\fP
is expanded into
\fBname\fP\(aqs
home directory path, is now included in the base \fBspec\fP code.
Previously, the feature was only available when an optional
command\-line editing package (such as GNU readline) was linked in.
.SH "Increased Maximum Number of Motors"
.sp
A \fBspec\fP installation (at ESRF) has finally run up against
the compiled\-in limit of
160 motors.
To accommodate them,
the maximum number of motors has been increased to 200.
(The next time the limit is reached, the \fBspec\fP code will
be modified to allow an unlimited number of motors.)
.SH "New \fBmotor_par(\(dqmodule\(dq)\fP Option"
.sp
A new
\fB"module"\fP
option to the
\fBmotor_par()\fP
function returns the configured module number of a motor.
Optional module numbers were introduced into the motor configuration
in \fBspec\fP release 5.04.03\-2.
.SH "New Home\-Position Optional Motor Parameter"
.sp
A new parameter is available
on the first optional motor\-parameter configuration screen to
configure the home position (in dial units) of the motor.
\fBspec\fP will use this parameter, if set, to assign the dial position
automatically on home searches.
Motor controllers that currently have this feature implemented are the
OMS models, the Newport MM4000/5/6 models, the Mclennan PM600/8 models
and the ANKA Gamma RST driver.
The parameter is accessible via the
\fB"home_position"\fP
option to the
\fBmotor_par()\fP
function.
If the home\-position argument is given to the standard
\fBhome\fP
macro or in the
\fBchg_dial()\fP
function, that value will take precedence over the value in the
\fBconfig\fP
file.
.SH "Fix For Tsuji PM16C Ethernet Interface"
.sp
A timing issue with the Tsuji PMC16C motor controllers when used with
the Ethernet interface, where the controller wouldn\(aqt respond quickly enough
between closing and opening the connection (as occurs during
\fBreconfig\fP)
has been accommodated by inserting a small delay in the \fBspec\fP code
before the connection is reopened.
.SH "Updates To Mclennan Motor Support"
.sp
A number of updates to the Mclennan motor controller
have been made, including the following:
The PM608 model, which is a multiplexed version of the PM600, is
now supported.
Home searches are now implemented for the PM600 series.
Also, the \fBspec\fP code should now work in both
\fB"quiet"\fP
and
\fB"verbose"\fP
modes (as set by configuration switches on the motor controller).
Finally, the new unit/module/channel configuration can be used for the
multiplexed PM381 and PM608 motors, where the module number
corresponds to the
controller address.
.SH "Updates To IMS MDrive Motor Support"
.sp
New \fBspec\fP code addresses the latest non\-backwards compatible
firmware (version 1.043) from IMS for their MDrive motor controllers.
Also, the commands for doing home and limit searches
with the MDrive controllers are now included in this \fBspec\fP release.
Finally, the error messages returned by the controller when
\fBspec\fP attempts to set already configured input switches
to the convention for limit assignments (switch 1 for plus limit,
switch 2 for negative limit) are suppressed.
\fBspec\fP sends the commands to ensure the limit switches are available,
although the software will still detect limits if the switches have
already been programmed to another convention.
.SH "Data Group Fix"
.sp
An old bug that affected use of data groups in the functions
\fBdata_dump()\fP,
\fBdata_fit()\fP,
\fBdata_plot()\fP
and
\fBdata_pipe()\fP,
where \fBspec\fP could experience a segmentation fault if the starting
point argument was greater than zero, has been fixed.
.SH "Bug Fix For \fBchelp\fP Utility On OSX"
.sp
A bug, where
\fBspec\fP\(aqs stand\-alone help formating utility,
\fBchelp\fP,
inappropriately ran in interactive mode on Mac OSX platforms
when its output had been
redirected through through a pipe, has been fixed.
.SH "Fix For ANKA RST Gamma Simulate Mode"
.sp
Missing checks on whether \fBspec\fP was operating in simulate mode in
calls of the
\fBanka_par()\fP
function have been added.
.SH "Fix For Detecting ESRF TACO Maxe Controller Failure"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now includes a check for for ESRF TACO Maxe controller failure.
If there are three consecutive failures of the
\fBdev_putget()\fP
calls for a particular motor, \fBspec\fP will mark the motor channel as
unusable.
The user must perform a
\fBreconfig\fP
to reenable the motor (after fixing whatever caused the hardware failure).
.SH "ESRF Warning Message Restored"
.sp
A warning that motors did not reach the final position, which
disappeared from \fBspec\fP when the Maxe support was modernized in release
5.02.03\-4, has been restored.
Also, the warning can now appear for non\-Maxe motors,
but only for TACO\-enabled \fBspec\fP installations.
.SH "October 26, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.04.03\-8"
.rs
.SH "Bug Fix For \fBread_motors()\fP Flags"
.sp
A bug, where setting bit 2 of the
\fBflags\fP
argument to
\fBread_motors()\fP
was supposed to indicate that position discrepancies should be resolved
silently in favor of the hardware but didn\(aqt, has been fixed.
.SH "October 5, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.04.03\-7"
.rs
.SH "Fix For Nested \fBeval()\fP Calls With Macro Functions"
.sp
A bug, where the return values of macro functions in nested calls of
\fBeval()\fP
were
sometimes lost, has been fixed.
This bug was discovered when a macro hardware
\fB_par()\fP
function was called from inside a macro hardware
\fB_cmd()\fP
function.
.SH "Improved Error Handling When Opening Socket Connections"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now uses a more sophisticated technique for opening socket connections.
Previously, if a host specified by IP address was unreachable, the
internal
\fBconnect()\fP
call would hang until interrupted with a
\fB^C\fP.
The new algorithm will time out after a default interval (currently four seconds)
if the host cannot be reached.
.SH "Improved Testing Of Connections To \fBspec\fP Server"
.sp
When a \fBspec\fP client opens a connection to a \fBspec\fP server on startup
or on a
\fBreconfig\fP,
errors such as an unresolvable host name or an unreachable host will
now generally
produce an immediate error message, with no more attempts made
to connect to that server until the next
\fBreconfig\fP.
If the host is up and reachable, but there is no \fBspec\fP server available at the
designated port, the \fBspec\fP client will keep trying, as in previous versions.
However, now a warning message will be printed on the first try.
.SH "Fix For Crash in \fBspec\fP Clients When One Server Platform Was Down"
.sp
A bug that could result in a crash during hardware initialization
when a \fBspec\fP client was configured for
\fBspec\fP servers on multiple platforms
where the computer running one of the servers was down has been fixed.
.SH "Another Motor Position Rounding Fix"
.sp
The fixes in releases 5.02.03\-5 and 5.03.01\-3 that dealt
with an obscure rounding bug
and then with the unintended consequences of the first fix
require one more fix.
Now, motor positions near zero can again
be set as small as the step size, even if
the step size is less than 1e\-10.
.SH "Fix For a Particular Am9513 Counter/Timer"
.sp
Although \fBspec\fP doesn\(aqt officially support the Measurement Computing
PCI CTR\-05/10 Am9513 compatible counter/timer modules (because they contain
a flaw which prevents counting to monitor to work), the cards can still
be used with \fBspec\fP for counting to time.
For the CTR\-10 model that contains two counter chips, \fBspec\fP now probes the correct
addresses for the second counter chip.
Previously, the registers associated with the digital I/O were probed, which would
disturb the contents of those registers.
.SH "Modifications Related To Command\-Line Editing Link Options"
.sp
Internal names in \fBspec\fP that conflict with names used in some
optional third\-party external command\-line editing
packages have been changed to remove the conflicts.
Also, \fBspec\fP\(aqs built\-in command\-line history has been updated
to handle automatic hardware polling during typing.
.SH "September 24, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.04.03\-6"
.rs
.SH "New \fBcounter_par()\fP Option"
.sp
The command
\fBcounter_par(mne, "monitor?")\fP
returns nonzero if the hardware counter channel associated with
\fBmne\fP
can be assigned as the monitor preset channel
using the command
\fBcounter(mne, "monitor")\fP.
Currently, counter/timers with such a capability are the
Kinetic Systems 3640 (CAMAC),
the Joerger VSC16/8 (VME),
the Struck SIS3820 (VME),
the National Instruments 6601/2 (PCI), the
MURR device (GPIB) and the EPICS scaler record.
.SH "Updated \fBcounters\fP Macro"
.sp
The
\fBcounters\fP
macro, used to assign the channels associated with the main detector
counter and the monitor counter,
will now use the
\fBcounter_par()\fP
function to change the counter hardware monitor assignment for hardware
that supports monitor channel assignment via software.
.SH "Support For Munich BR\-tronik IPS Motor Controller"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now includes support for a motor controller called the BR\-tronik IPS,
designed, built and used at LMU Munich.
.SH "September 4, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.04.03\-5"
.rs
.SH "Motor Offset Rounding Bug Revisited"
.sp
The fix of an obscure motor rounding bug in \fBspec\fP release 5.02.03\-5
created another bug that was partially fixed in release 5.03.01\-3, but
not entirely.
The bug would, under certain circumstances,
cause nonzero user angles with nonzero offsets
to print with decimal parts on the
order of 1e\-9 and angles at zero to print with decimal parts on the
order of 1e\-16.
This release should complete the fix begun in the 5.03.01\-3 release,
.SH "Support For SBS Model 946 Version 2 Driver on Sun"
.sp
The SBS 946 version 2 driver for Sun platforms for
the SBS model 61x/62x VME controllers
is now supported.
.SH "September 1, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.04.03\-4"
.rs
.SH "Portability Issues Addressed"
.sp
Several code changes were needed to allow \fBspec\fP to compile
using gcc version 3.3.
Also, problems with state\- and settings\-file locking over NFS
have been addressed.
.SH "August 27, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.04.03\-3"
.rs
.SH "New \fBremote_stat()\fP Client Function"
.sp
A new
\fBremote_stat()\fP
function is available on the \fBspec\fP client
to check whether
a particular server is currently connected.
See the
\fI\%server\fP help file for additional information.
.SH "New \fBstatus/ready\fP Server Property"
.sp
A new
\fB"status/ready"\fP
property is available on the \fBspec\fP server that will return a
value that indicates whether
the server is ready to execute the next client command.
See the
\fI\%server\fP help file for additional information.
.SH "Bug Fix For Watched Variables in Server"
.sp
A bug introduced just before the server/client code was
put into the official release, where
\fB"watched"\fP
variables became unregistered in the server
the first time they were modified,
has been fixed.
.SH "Improved Hex Dump For Socket Debugging"
.sp
The optional hexadecimal debug format for socket I/O (selected with
\fBDEBUG\fP
bits 0x400040) will now also show offsets and printable ASCII
representations of the data, along the lines of conventional
hex\-dump utilities.
.SH "\fBshow_state\fP Utility Checks New Checksum"
.sp
The
\fBshow_state\fP
utility, available to display the contents of a user\(aqs state file,
will now also
do a test on the state\-file checksum that was
introduced in the previous \fBspec\fP release.
.SH "Improved Error Messages On Array Allocation Failure"
.sp
\fBspec\fP will now print the name and requested dimensions of arrays
that are too big for the memory allocation calls.
.SH "Initial Support For Struck SIS3820 Scalers"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now includes support for the Struck SIS3820 multichannel
scaler (MCS) VME module.
The initial support only covers use of the device as regular preset
counters (of which there are 32 channels).
MCS support will come later.
The current SIS3820 firmware does not allow the counters to be read
back while counting, but that feature is expected to become available
in a forthcoming SIS3820 firmware update.
.SH "Support For Compumotor OEM750 Motor Controllers"
.sp
The code that supports the Compumotor AX motor controller
has been modified to allow it also to
work with the Compumotor models OEM750, OEM650,
OEM350 and OEM010 motor controllers.
Select
\fBCMAX\fP
as the controller type and
\fB"Compumotor AX (Serial)"\fP
as the device type for all such motors.
.SH "August 18, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.04.03\-2"
.rs
.SH "Server/Client Updates"
.sp
A number of updates are included for the new server/client features
introduced in release 5.04.03:
.IP \(bu 2
Server port number assignment is now flexible.
A server can be assigned a single port number, a range of port numbers
or left to use a built\-in default port number range (6510\-6530).
The \fBspec\fP invocation argument syntax for server mode has changed to
reflect the new options.
.IP \(bu 2
New
\fBhello\fP
commands are available for clients to discover servers.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBspec\fP clients can specify a server on a particular
host by either a port number or
by a \fBspec\fP process name.
.IP \(bu 2
A better job is done reestablishing input stream alignment on both
server and client
in the event
nonconforming data is received.
.IP \(bu 2
Improvements have been made to the locking among threads in the server,
fixing some race conditions.
.IP \(bu 2
The handling of associative arrays when passed to and from the
server works better.
.IP \(bu 2
Problems with byte swapping (when needed) in the server are fixed.
.sp
See the revised \fI\%server\fP help file for further information.
.SH "New Optional Module Number For Motor Unit/Channel"
.sp
To accommodate motor controllers that require more than two
parameters (unit and channel) to specify motors, the
\fBedconf\fP
configuration editor now allows either two or three
slash\-separated numbers.
If three numbers are given, the first is unit, the last is channel
and the middle is the new parameter, which \fBspec\fP will refer to as
module number.
The motor controllers in \fBspec\fP that currently require a module (or crate or
rack or sub\-unit) number
(ACS SPI\-8,
DCX serial,
ECB in multiplexed mode,
Mclennan PM381,
New Focus 8732/8750/8753
and XIA HSC) still
use the overloaded
channel number to pass the
information, but will be modified
to recognize the new module number feature in future releases.
.SH "Argument Change For Macro Hardware \fB_config()\fP Macros"
.sp
The arguments for the macro hardware
\fB_config()\fP
macros, when called for the individual motor and counter channels,
have been changed to accommodate the new
\fBmodule\fP
number option.
The calling sequence is now
\fBprefix_config(mne, type, unit, module, chan)\fP.
See the
\fI\%mac_hdw\fP help file for details.
.SH "Fix For \fBedconf\fP Default VME Addresses"
.sp
The hardware configuration editor
\fBedconf\fP
now correctly shows the default address when VME modules are
selected on the
\fBD\fPevices
screen.
.SH "Fixes For Socket\-To\-Serial Support"
.sp
The socket\-to\-serial support in \fBspec\fP, which
allows any supported serial device to be used via
compatible Ethernet\-to\-serial adapters, was missing some internal
code which could prevent
certain motor controllers
(Compumotor AX and 3000,
MAC Science MXC,
Mclennan PM301,
Newport MM2000/3000 in daisy\-chain mode,
PMC DCX\-100,
Rigaku RINT\-2000 and XIA HSC)
from working
properly in socket\-to\-serial mode.
The missing code has been added.
.SH "Improved Detection of Corrupted State Files"
.sp
This \fBspec\fP release attempts to do a better job of detecting corrupted
user state files, automatically doing a fresh start rather than
crashing or quitting with an error message.
The state file is now written out with a checksum, which will be
recalculated and compared before the file is used to restore the state.
Also, additional checks are done on
the sanity of parameters as the file is read.
State files from prior \fBspec\fP releases will still be recognized,
but state files saved
with this version will not be usable by older \fBspec\fP releases.
.SH "\fBprdef\fP Source\-File Comment Fixed"
.sp
An old bug, where the comment
printed by
\fBprdef\fP
to show the source file for the macro
incorrectly eliminated embedded
\fB/../\fP
strings, has been fixed.
Unnecessary
\fB./\fP,
\fB/./\fP,
and
\fB/../\fP
are still eliminated and
\fBSPECD\fP
is still substituted for the path of the \fBspec\fP auxiliary file directory,
but all should now be done correctly.
.SH "Help Formatter Bug Fix"
.sp
A bug introduced in \fBspec\fP release 5.01.03,
where the help formatter would break lines containing
highlighted text before they were full, has been fixed.
.SH "New \fBsuv\fP Geometry for ESRF D32 Beamline"
.sp
The initial adaptation in \fBspec\fP of a geometry called
\fBsuv\fP
is included for the
surface ultrahigh vacuum instrument at the ESRF D32 beamline.
.SH "July 22, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.04.03\-1"
.rs
.SH "New Encoder Option for Mclennan PM600"
.sp
If the
\fBPM600_E\fP
controller type is selected in the
\fBconfig\fP
file
for the Mclennan PM600 motor controller, \fBspec\fP will read the encoder
position rather than the commanded position from the controller.
.SH "July 20, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.04.03"
.rs
.SH "New Server/Client Feature"
.sp
The \fBspec\fP server/client features, long in development,
are now included with the standard \fBspec\fP release.
See the
\fI\%server\fP help file for details on the implementation.
Although the server/client features work well in many situations,
there are probably still flaws that need further development to correct.
Please start gently with the current release.
Keep CSS appraised
of any anomalies noticed or features that seem lacking.
