.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBnewfile [file_name] [current_scan_number]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBnewfile\fP macro is used to initialize a new data file
or reopen an old data file.
You might open a new data file for each new sample or each new experiment.
There is no specific limit to the number of scans you can put in a data file,
although for practical considerations, you may want to start a new file after
you have accumulated one or two hundred scans or when the size of the
data file makes it unwieldy.
.sp
If \fBfile_name\fP doesn\(aqt contain the \fB/\fP character, and
if there is a directory named \fBdata\fP in the current directory,
the file is opened in that directory.
If you give \fBnull\fP as a file name, \fB/dev/null\fP is used.
Otherwise the file name or path name given by \fBfile_name\fP is used.
.sp
The next scan written to the file will have
scan number \fBcurrent_scan_number\fP +1.
.sp
You can use \fBnewfile\fP to reopen an existing data file.
New scans will be placed at then end of the file.
You can use command \fBu grep #S file_name\fP
to find the last scan number in an existing file.
