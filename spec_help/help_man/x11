.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
You can have \fBspec\fP draw high resolution graphics in X Window System
windows by selecting high resolution graphics (with the \fBsetplot\fP macro)
and setting the \fBGTERM\fP global variable to
\fBx11\fP. You can set \fBGTERM\fP either as an
environment variable in the shell or by assigning it the
\fB"x11"\fP string while running \fBspec\fP.
However, each time you start \fBspec\fP, the environment variable will override
a previously assigned value to \fBGTERM\fP.
.sp
The process that \fBspec\fP creates
(named \fBx11filt\fP) to do the plotting looks at the \fBDISPLAY\fP
environment variable.
The value of \fBspec\fP\(aqs built\-in variable named \fBDISPLAY\fP
will be propagated to the
\fBx11filt\fP process environment when it is spawned.
Thus it is possible to change the host on which the plots are drawn while
running \fBspec\fP by assigning new values to \fBDISPLAY\fP. For example,
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
DISPLAY="host1:0"; plot_cntl("filter1,open")
DISPLAY="host2:0"; plot_cntl("filter2,open")
.ft P

will create plot windows on two different hosts.
.SH "RESOURCE FILE ITEMS (\fB.Xdefaults\fP)"
.rs
.sp
Some parameters associated with the X windows plot can be set in an
\fB.Xdefaults\fP file in your home directory.
You can include some or all of the following parameters:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
spec.geometry:      =640x380\-20+10
spec.Foreground:    black
spec.Background:    white
spec.Backstore:     on
spec.Retained:      off
spec.BorderWidth:   4
spec.Border:        black
spec.Font:          \-\-\-\-r\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-*
spec.FontDebug:     0
spec.Colors:        on
spec.AutoRaise:     on
spec.DotSize:       small
.ft P

.RE
.sp
The values for the parameters given above are the defaults.
.sp
Up to five X graphics windows may be used with \fBspec\fP simultaneously.
Parameters specified in the \fB.Xdefaults\fP file with the keyword
\fBspec\fP will apply to all, unless overridden by the following.
Parameters specified with the keyword \fBspec_1\fP,
will apply to the window selected with the command
\fBplot_cntl("filter1")\fP, parameters specified with the keyword
\fBspec_2\fP will apply to the window selected
with the command \fBplot_cntl("filter2")\fP, etc.
An additional \fBx11filt\fP process is created for each window.
.sp
The \fBgeometry\fP parameter uses the conventional notation to set the
width and height of the window and the offsets from the edges of the
root window.  All the values are in pixels.
.sp
The \fBBackground\fP and \fBForeground\fP parameters
set the colors associated with color numbers zero and one,
respectively.
.sp
The \fBBackstore\fP and \fBRetained\fP parameters
select how the image in the window will be saved when the window is
covered up by another window.
The backing\-store method can be the most efficient way to preserve
the window contents if the graphics display supports it.
For the retained\-pixmap method, the
\fBx11filt\fP process performs all the drawing operations
on both the active display
and an in\-memory copy of the window, and uses the in\-memory copy to
redraw uncovered portions of the window on \fBexpose\fP events.
The retained\-pixmap method is generally
not as efficient as using backing store, but may be necessary
if backing store is unavailable.
If backing store is requested, but unsupported by the display,
the retained\-pixmap method is automatically used.
.sp
The \fBBorderWidth\fP and
\fBBorder\fP parameters select the width and color of the window border, but
are generally ignored when a window manager (such as \fBmwm\fP) is running.
.sp
The
\fBFont\fP parameter uses the standard notation for specifying application fonts
in X Windows.  The default font uses the
\fB*\fP to wild card all fields except the fourth, which
selects a \fBroman\fP font.
The graphics program selects among all
the fonts that match the pattern the one that best fits
the height and width of the window when the program
first starts and each
time the window is resized.
The font selected can be limited to a single family in your
\fB.Xdefaults\fP file with syntax as in following examples,
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
spec.Font: \-\-lucidatypewriter\-bold\-r\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-*
spec.Font: \-\-fixed\-medium\-r\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-*
spec.Font: \-\-courier\-medium\-r\-
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
Note, your choice of a font can be aided with the X utility
\fBxlsfonts\fP which lists all the available fonts, and the utility
\fBxfontsel\fP which can be used to inspect the available fonts.
.sp
The \fBx11filt\fP program also supports
\fBscalable\fP fonts introduced in X11R5, when such a font is selected using
the \fB.Xdefaults\fP resources or the
\fBplot_cntl()\fP \fB"font="\fP option described below.
For scalable fonts, the server uses an algorithm to fit the font to
whatever size is requested.  Scalable fonts can be identified by the
zeros in the 7th, 8th and 12th fields of their long name.
For example,
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
spec.Font: \-adobe\-courier\-bold\-r\-normal\-\-0\-0\-0\-0\-m\-0\-iso8859\-1
spec.Font: \-adobe\-courier\-medium\-r\-normal\-\-0\-0\-0\-0\-m\-0\-iso8859\-1
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
are a couple of possible scalable fonts.
.sp
Please note that on some older systems, the \fBfonts.dir\fP files in the
\fB/usr/lib/X11/fonts\fP directories aren\(aqt up to date, so the
\fBx11filt\fP graphics program will try to load a font that doesn\(aqt exist.
This problem can be fixed by having the system administrator run the
\fBmkfontdir\fP command.
.sp
Setting the \fBFontDebug\fP property to a nonzero value will cause the
\fBx11filt\fP filter process to display some font diagnostics on the
terminal screen, which may be useful if there are problems with the
font appearance.
Debugging can be turned off either by setting the property value back to
zero or with the \fBplot_cntl()\fP 9900 command described below.
.sp
The program will use color if it determines you are using
a color display.  The \fBColors\fP parameter lets you turn use of colors off.
.sp
By default, the graphics window will be brought to the top of the
stacking order among its siblings each time its contents are changed.
To disable this feature, set the \fBAutoRaise\fP parameter to off.
.sp
The \fBDotSize\fP parameter controls the size
of the smallest point drawn by \fBspec\fP.
Possible values are
.sp
.RS 4m
.IP \(bu 2
\fBscaled\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpixel\fP
.IP \(bu 2

.RE
.sp
The \fBscaled\fP points use the X library
\fBXFillArc()\fP routine to draw a filled circle.
The result depends on the platform and is often nonsymmetric.
Before being a configurable option, the default dot size was
\fBscaled\fP. The default is now \fBsmall\fP.
.SH "\fBplot_cntl()\fP COMMANDS"
.rs
.sp
You can assign a title to the graphics window using the command
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBplot_cntl("title=This is a title")\fP
.RE
.sp
from \fBspec\fP.  The title can be changed at any time.
.sp
You can also change the size and position of the window at any time using
the \fBplot_cntl()\fP function as in
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBplot_cntl("geometry=640x380\-20+10")\fP
.RE
.sp
Fonts can be selected using
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBplot_cntl("font=\-adobe\-courier\-bold\-r\-normal\-\-20\-140\-100\-100\-m\-110\-iso8859\-1")\fP
.RE
.sp
for example.  If a non\-scalable font is chosen this way,
the font size will no longer
change to match the size of the window.
Any valid font name can be used, including short alias names, as in,
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBplot_cntl("font=8x16")\fP
.RE
.sp
Several special features can be accessed using
.sp
.RS 4m
\fBplot_cntl("cmd=numb")\fP

\fB9109\fP	turns auto\-raise mode on

Also, the \fBnumb\fP argument can be
a space\- or comma\-separated list of numbers.
.SH "DETACHING A WINDOW"
.rs
.sp
You can make a detached copy of an active \fBspec\fP X11 plot window
by pressing the control key and any mouse button
while the mouse cursor is over the window
(as of \fBspec\fP release 5.01.02\-7).
A new X11 window will be created that contains the contents of the
original window.
The contents of the new window will no longer change, and the window
will remain on the screen, even after \fBspec\fP exits.
Use the window manager close button or menu item to delete the window.
