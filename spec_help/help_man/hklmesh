\fBhklmesh Q1 start1 end1 intervals1
Q2 start2 end2 intervals2 time\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBhklmesh\fP macro scans over a grid in reciprocal space in the
\fBQ1\-Q2\fP plane, putting the results in one scan entry in the data file
(as opposed to an \fBhklscan\fP inside a for\-loop which creates many scans).
\fBQ1\fP and \fBQ2\fP are literally \fBH\fP, \fBK\fP or \fBL\fP. The grid runs from
\fBstart1\fP to \fBend1\fP for \fBintervals1+1\fP points
for the reciprocal space coordinate \fBQ1\fP and from
\fBstart2\fP to \fBend2\fP for \fBintervals2+1\fP points
for the \fBQ2\fP coordinate.
Count time is given by \fBtime\fP, which if positive,
specifies seconds and if negative, specifies monitor counts.
.sp
The scan over \fBQ1\fP is done at each point in the scan over
\fBQ2\fP. That is, the scan of the first coordinate is nested
within the scan of the second coordinate.
