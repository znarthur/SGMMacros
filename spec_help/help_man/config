.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
The \fBconfig\fP macro runs the configuration editor program
\fBedconf\fP for the current spectrometer geometry.
This program displays several configuration screens.
The \fBmotor\fP screen presents all the motor related parameters
(step\-size, stepping rate, limits, etc.)
as well as the current positions of all motors.
The \fBscaler\fP screen allows you to configure the scaler (counter)
names and mnemonics and also which hardware channel is
associated with which name.
The \fBdevice\fP screen lets you select non\-CAMAC motor controllers,
timer/counters and MCA\-type devices.
The \fBinterface\fP screen is used to select a CAMAC controller, a GPIB controller,
and ports for user\-level serial devices and user\-level PC I/O ports.
If a CAMAC device is defined, the \fBCAMAC\fP screen
that shows the slot configuration will become accessible.
.sp
Help is available while running the configuration editor using the
commands \fB?\fP and \fBH\fP.
.sp
When you exit \fBedconf\fP, \fBspec\fP rereads the modified configuration
and re\-initializes the hardware devices.
.sp
On some installations, only authorized users are able
to modify the hardware configuration.
