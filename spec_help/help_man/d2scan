\fBd2scan motor1 start1 end1 motor2 start2 end2 intervals time\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
\fBd2scan\fP scans two motors, as specified by \fBmotor1\fP and
\fBmotor2\fP. Each motor moves the same number of intervals.
If each motor is at a position
\fBX\fP before the scan begins, it will be scanned from
\fBX+start\fP to \fBX+end\fP.
The step size for each motor is
\fB(start\-end)/intervals\fP.
The number of data points collected will be \fBintervals+1\fP.
Count time is given by \fBtime\fP, which if positive, specifies
seconds and if negative, specifies monitor counts.
.sp
Upon termination, the motors are returned to their starting positions.
