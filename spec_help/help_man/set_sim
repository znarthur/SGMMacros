.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
Simulate mode allows a user to exercise the program without
accessing any of the hardware interfaces (for the most part, see below)
or updating the motor\-settings file.
.sp
The function \fBset_sim()\fP is used to turn simulate mode
on and off.
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBset_sim(0)\fP
\- 
Turns simulate mode off.  Returns previous state.
.HP 5m
."
\fBset_sim(arg)\fP
\- 
Turns simulate mode on if \fBarg\fP is greater than zero.
If bit 4 (0x10) is set in \fBarg\fP, the user\-level
\fBsleep()\fP function is simulated, that is, \fBspec\fP
does not sleep (as of \fBspec\fP release 6.00.06).
Returns previous state.
.HP 5m
."
\fBset_sim(\-1)\fP
\- 
Doesn\(aqt change mode, but returns current state.  Bit
assignments in the return value are as follows:
.sp
.RS 5m
.RS 4m
.TS
;
l l l .
Bit 0	0x01	Simulate mode by \fBset_sim()\fP command
Bit 1	0x02	Simulate mode on start up (\fB\-s\fP flag)
Bit 2	0x04	No write access to \fBsettings\fP file
Bit 3	0x08	Hardware locked by another user
Bit 4	0x10	User\-level sleep simulated

Both \fBset_sim(0)\fP and \fBset_sim(arg)\fP, where \fBarg\fP
is greater than zero,
wait for moving and
counting to finish before changing the mode.
Also \fBset_sim(0)\fP always rereads the
motor settings file to restore the motor positions.
.sp
Access to the user\-level socket interface is disabled when
in simulate mode, but can be left on by using the command
\fBsock_par("ignore_sim", 1)\fP.
See the \fI\%sockets\fP help file for details.
.sp
Simulate mode is turned on when \fBspec\fP
is invoked with the \fB\-s\fP flag and can\(aqt be turned off without
restarting \fBspec\fP.
Also, if there is no write access to the \fBspec\fP
\fBsettings\fP file or if the hardware is locked because another user
is running an instance of \fBspec\fP using the same hardware
configuration file, simulate mode is also turned on and cannot
be turned off without restarting \fBspec\fP.
.sp
Users normally use the macros \fBonsim\fP and
\fBoffsim\fP to turn simulate mode on and off.
The macros document the changes in the data file.
.sp
The \fBconfig\fP macro automatically invokes
\fBedconf\fP with the \fB\-s\fP flag when simulate mode is on.
This means the configuration file can\(aqt be changed using
\fBconfig\fP when in simulate mode.
