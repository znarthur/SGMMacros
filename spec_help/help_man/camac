.SH "BUILT\-IN FUNCTIONS"
.rs
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fBca_get(i, a)\fP
\- 
Returns the 24\-bit value read (using F = 0) from the
\fBi\fP\-th (\fBi\fP = 0, 1, ... ) CAMAC I/O device (from the
\fBconfig\fP file) using subaddress \fBa\fP.
.HP 5m
."
\fBca_put(x, i, a)\fP
\- 
Writes the 24\-bit value \fBx\fP (using F = 16) to the
\fBi\fP\-th (\fBi\fP = 0, 1, ... )
CAMAC I/O device (from the \fBconfig\fP file) using subaddress
\fBa\fP. Returns the value written.
.HP 5m
."
\fBca_fna(f, n, a [, v])\fP
\- 
Sends the arbitrary FNA command to the module in slot
\fBn\fP. If the dataway command given by
\fBf\fP is a write function, the 24\-bit value to be written is contained
in \fBv\fP. If the dataway command given by
\fBf\fP is a read command, the function returns the 24\-bit value obtained
from the module.
The user should avoid issuing commands that would cause a LAM and
should certainly avoid issuing commands to slots that are being
used for motor or counter control by \fBspec\fP\(aqs internal hardware code.
.HP 5m
."
\fBca_cntl(cmd [, arg\fP])
\- 
Performs the selected CAMAC crate command according to the parameter
\fBcmd\fP, as follows:
.RS 5m
.sp
.PD 0.2v
.RS 0m
.HP 5m
."
\fB"Z"\fP or \fB"init"\fP
\- 
performs a crate initialize (reset).
.HP 5m
."
\fB"C"\fP or \fB"clear"\fP
\- 
performs a crate clear.
.HP 5m
."
\fB"inhibit"\fP
\- 
set crate inhibit if \fBarg\fP is 1 and clears crate inhibit if
\fBarg\fP is 0.

During normal operation, you should not need to issue these commands.
You should probably issue a \fBreconfig\fP
after sending a crate initialize or clear.

.SH "MULTIPLE CRATE CONTROLLERS"
.rs
.sp
As of \fBspec\fP release 5.06.02\-1, up to four CAMAC crate controllers
can be configured at a time.
Currently, use of more than one instance of a particular controller
is supported only for the Jorway 73A, the KS\-3929 and the
DSP 6001 controller models.  Otherwise, only
only one instance of a particular type or model of
a controller can be used at a time.
.sp
Also, the only CAMAC modules that currently can be installed in
other than the first crate (crate 0) are the E250,
KS\-3655, KS\-3610, KS\-3112, KS\-3116, KS\-3195, QS\-450,
RTC\-018 and XIA DXP\-4C/4C2X MCA modules.
.sp
In addition, the user\-level functions \fBca_get()\fP, \fBca_put()\fP,
\fBca_fna()\fP and
\fBca_cntl()\fP currently only work with the first crate.
.sp
The multiple crate support will be extended for multiple identical
controllers, additional modules and to the user\-level functions
in the future as needed.
.sp
To configure additional controllers from the \fBedconf\fP configuration
editor (invoked by the \fBconfig\fP macro),
use \fB^F\fP or \fB^B\fP on the CAMAC entry of the
\fBI\fPnterfaces screen.
.sp
To configure modules in the additional crates, type
\fBC\fP from the CAMAC crate screen to cycle through
the crates associated with each controller.
.sp
For scaler modules installed in other than the first CAMAC crate,
the crate number must be entered in the same field as the unit number
on the \fBS\fPcaler screen of the configuration editor using the
crate/unit notation, as in 1/0 for crate 1, unit 0.
.sp
For motor modules installed in other than the first CAMAC crate,
the crate number is entered as [crate/]unit/channel in the
unit/[module/]channel field of the motor screen.
.sp
If only one crate is configured, the \fBconfig\fP file syntax is the same as before.
When multiple crates are configured, additional information specifying
crate number for each module and controller is added to the
\fBconfig\fP file.
