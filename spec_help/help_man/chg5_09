.SH "May 19, 2011 \- RELEASE 5.09.02\-4"
.rs
.SH "Fix For Macro Function Assignment To Unset and Untyped Variables"
.sp
An unintended side effect of the stricter associative array syntax checking
introduced in \fBspec\fP release 5.09.02\-2 prevented assignment of
associative arrays to variables not yet used and not explicitly
declared as associative arrays.
Such usage was allowed in the past and is restored with the fix
in this release.
.SH "May 13, 2011 \- RELEASE 5.09.02\-3"
.rs
.SH "Fix For Macro Function Return Of Associative Arrays"
.sp
A bug, where the ability to return an associative array from a macro
function was broken in the previous release,
has been fixed.
.SH "May 5, 2011 \- RELEASE 5.09.02\-2"
.rs
.SH "New Command Line Option To Open Log Files"
.sp
A new start\-up option to specify an output file
on the command line
is available, as in
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
spec \-l somefile.log
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
Output to the file will begin immediately,
so will include
the initial hardware configuration messages.
The files will be opened even when starting fresh.
.SH "Support For USB DAC As DAC Motor"
.sp
The Measurement Computing USB\-3100 series digital\-to\-analog
converter (DAC) modules are now supported as DAC motors in \fBspec\fP.
See the
\fI\%dac\fP help file for details.
.SH "Support For Digital I/O On DAC Devices"
.sp
The PCI and USB DAC devices supported by \fBspec\fP as
DAC motors
usually include digital
I/O lines as part of the hardware package.
\fBspec\fP now supports configuration and control of the digital I/O
lines directly using
\fBmotor_par()\fP
commands.
See the
\fI\%dac\fP help file for details.
.SH "Fix To Associative Array Assignment"
.sp
A syntax error, where assignment of an associative array (say
\fBA\fP)
to a single
associative array element, as in
\fBx[0]=A\fP,
has been quietly ignored
from the earliest \fBspec\fP releases.
Since \fBspec\fP release 5.07.02\-9, such a command would result in
actual creation of invalid objects.
The unallowed assignment is now detected, an error message is displayed
and control returns
to the main prompt.
.SH "Fixes To Array Assignment In Server"
.sp
Use of the
\fBvar\fP
property in the \fBspec\fP server for assignment to associative array
elements has been cleaned up.
Previously, the following (where
\fBA\fP
is an associative array with more than one element)
was not detected as an error when received
by a \fBspec\fP server:
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
prop_put("localhost:fourc", "var/x[1]", A)
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
In addition, an assignment of the sort
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
prop_put("localhost:fourc", "var/x[1]", A[3])
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
would assign
to
\fBx[3]\fP
rather than
\fBx[1]\fP.
Finally, it had been previously possible to use the
\fBvar\fP
property to create new elements in the \fBspec\fP server\(aqs
built\-in associative
arrays, such as
\fBA\fP
or
\fBS\fP,
which is not allowed.
All these issues should now be fixed.
.SH "Fixes For XIA DXP Support"
.sp
A bug, introduced in \fBspec\fP release 5.08.06\-1, which could
break support for the XIA DXP modules if more than one MCA
was configured, has been fixed.
In addition, the CSS version of the XIA DXP support library,
available at
.RS 3m
.sp
.nf
.ft CB
http://certif.com/downloads/extras/xia_dxp_css.tgz
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
has been updated to work correctly when used with 64\-bit binaries.
.SH "Reversion For User\-level GPIB\-ENET Interruptible Transfers"
.sp
The feature allowing
\fB^C\fP
interrupts during user\-level GPIB calls, such as
\fBgpib_put()\fP
and
\fBgpib_get()\fP,
introduced in \fBspec\fP release 5.09.01\-3, has been disabled for the
National Instruments GPIB\-ENET device.
.SH "Fix For Unintended Access To Unresponsive Controllers"
.sp
In a fix for controller unit number assignments in \fBspec\fP release
5.06.02\-8, a bug was introduced into the
code for a number of motor controllers and timer/counters
where the flag to mark an unresponsive controller was inadvertently
cleared, resulting in wasted time doing presence tests on
individual channels or on attempts to access unavailable hardware,
resulting in spurious error messages.
That problem has been fixed.
Affected controllers were the
Detel S21DC,
Huber 9000/9300\-LCD,
JVL SMI20B,
Kohzu SC\-200/400/800,
MURR counters,
Micro\-Controle ITL09,
New Focus Picomotor 8732,
Newport ESP300,
Newport MM2000/2500/3000/4000/4005/4006,
Newport PM500,
Oriel Encoder Mike 18092,
PI C\-630/663/804/844/860/862/863,
PI E710,
PMC Corp DCX
and
Tsuji CT16/NCT08
models.
.SH "Small Fix For JVL Motors"
.sp
The generation of a spurious configuration\-time error message associated with
the JVL motor support that could appear with particular hardware configurations
has been fixed.
.SH "Small Fix For ACS MCB\-4B Motors"
.sp
An issue with the MCB\-4B motor controller support, introduced in \fBspec\fP release
5.08.02\-1, where if the configured value
for the acceleration parameter was too big, \fBspec\fP programmed the controller with
the minimum allowed value rather than the maximum allowed value, has been fixed.
.SH "Fix For Misspelled Parameter For Canberra MCAs"
.sp
The
\fBmca_par()\fP
parameter
\fB"elapsed_counts"\fP
was misspelled in the Canberra Multiport II and Lynx MCA support with the
position of the initial s and p characters reversed.
The misspelled version is no longer recognized.
Users should adjust any macros that relied on the mispelling.
.SH "Updated \fBs1d2\fP Geometry For Pseudo \fBTau\fP Rotation"
.sp
The
\fBs1d2\fP
three\-motor geometry code (1 sample rotation, 2 detector rotations)
now recognizes a configuration where the
\fBtau\fP
detector rotation consists of a two\-motor configuration consisting
of a translation perpendicular to the line from the detector to the
sample and a rotation of the detector.
Real motors corresponding to those motions should be configured as
\fBtauT\fP
and
\fBtauR\fP.
The
\fBtau\fP
motor will be a pseudomotor.
New geometry\-specific macros
\fBsetlen\fP
to set the distance from the detector to the sample
and
\fBsettrack\fP
to turn on and off the tracking of
\fBtauR\fP
and
\fBtauT\fP
with
\fBtau\fP
are provided.
See the
\fBgeo_s1d2.c\fP
files and the
\fBs1d2.src\fP
macros for details.
.SH "March 1, 2011 \- RELEASE 5.09.02\-1"
.rs
.SH "Fixes For Multiple Master Timers"
.sp
An issue, where the first master timer in the
\fBconfig\fP
file was not necessarily the timer that gated software\-controlled counters,
has been fixed.
When multiple master timers are used (a feature added in \fBspec\fP release
5.09.01\-1), the first such timer device in the
\fBconfig\fP
file is the
\fB"supreme"\fP
master and will control when commands are sent to start and stop
non\-hardware gated counters and MCA\- and CCD\-type devices.
.SH "Updates For TACO VCT6 Device Server Support"
.sp
The \fBspec\fP support for the TACO VCT6 device server has been
updated to support multiple device server instances, with
each instance allowed to contain a master timer.
In addition, reading of the counter results is now
more efficient.
.SH "Preliminary Support For Physik Instrumente E\-712 Piezo Controller"
.sp
This \fBspec\fP release supports the Physik Instrumente
E\-712 piezo controller over serial and Ethernet interfaces.
See the
\fI\%E712\fP help file for details.
.SH "Updates For Newport ESP300/301 Support"
.sp
The built\-in code for the Newport ESP300 and ESP301 motor controllers
now includes support for the following standard optional motor parameters:
\fB"deceleration"\fP,
\fB"home_base_rate"\fP,
\fB"dc_dead_band"\fP
and
\fB"dc_settle_time"\fP.
Previously, the deceleration was programmed to the same value as the acceleration,
and will still be, if the optional
\fB"deceleration"\fP
parameter is unset.
The specific ESP300/301 parameter for
\fB"home_base_rate"\fP
was not previously programmed.
The dead\-time and settle\-time parameters are associated with \fBspec\fP internal
operation.
If
\fB"dc_dead_band"\fP
and
\fB"dc_settle_time"\fP
both have non\-zero values,
\fBspec\fP will wait for at least
the duration specified by the settle time after the controller
indicates the move is done and also until the position is within
the dead\-band of the target position.
If the motor doesn\(aqt settle
into the dead\-band within 5 seconds, \fBspec\fP will print an error message
that the motor isn\(aqt settling.
.SH "Fix For Amptek MCA 8000A Support"
.sp
A bug in \fBspec\fP\(aqs support for the new Amptek MCA 8000A firmware that
sometimes resulted in a program crash when reading data from the MCA
has been fixed.
.SH "Updates For USB \fBudev\fP Support On \fBLinux\fP"
.sp
The \fBspec\fP
\fBInstall\fP
script will now automatically install a rules file for \fBspec\fP\-supported
USB devices in
\fB/etc/udev/rules.d\fP
if the
\fBLinux\fP
platforms supports the
\fBudev\fP
feature.
The rules file will ensure that all \fBspec\fP\-supported USB devices will
be accessible to ordinary users running \fBspec\fP.
.SH "Updates For Am9513\-based Counter/Timers, Including USB Support"
.sp
This \fBspec\fP release includes
several updates to the Am9513\-based counter/timer support.
First, the Measurement Computing USB\-4300 series models are
supported (currently, only on
\fBLinux\fP
platforms).
Second, the Measurement Computing PCI\-CTR05/10/20HD are now fully supported
(previously, counting\-to\-monitor didn\(aqt work).
Finally, direct access to the digital I/O ports is available on all cards
without requiring additional hardware configuration.
Access is via
\fBcounter_par()\fP
commands.
See the updated
\fI\%am9513\fP help file for details.
.SH "Updates in Attocube ANC350 Support To Match Hardware Firmware Updates"
.sp
Non\-backward compatible updates in the firmware included in the ANC350
piezo motor controllers have been addressed, along with support for new
parameters.
The
\fB"poslooprange"\fP
is now only used with older firmware units.
The new
\fB"poslooptime"\fP,
\fB"humpsensitivity"\fP,
\fB"humpstepsmin"\fP
and
\fB"humptime"\fP
parameters are available for newer firmware units.
.SH "Fix For Standard \fBscan_head\fP Macro"
.sp
A problem with the standard
\fB_head\fP
macro (the default definition for
\fBscan_head\fP),
where an error occurred if doing a scan when no
motors were configured, has been fixed.
.SH "Fix For \fBconfig\fP File Update During Install"
.sp
Previously, when updating \fBspec\fP using the standard
\fBInstall\fP
script, values for the optional hardware
\fB"read_mode"\fP
parameter would be reset to zero during the procedure
where the installation checked for compatibility between the
\fBconfig\fP
file and the \fBspec\fP update.
That issue has been fixed.
.SH "Fixes For Two \fBlibedit\fP Issues"
.sp
A bug introduced into the
\fBlibedit\fP
package, where command history recall by number using the
\fB!N\fP
notation would return the command
\fBN\fP+1,
has been fixed in the upstream source and in the version distributed with
\fBspec\fP.
In addition, a patch to the upstream source to restore inclusion of the directory
"\fB/\fP" indicator with filename
completion, included in \fBspec\fP release 5.08.04\-4 but inadvertently removed
in release 5.09.01\-1, has been put back.
.SH "December 15, 2010 \- RELEASE 5.09.01\-4"
.rs
.SH "Updated Support For ULS Counter/Timer"
.sp
The support for the Korean ULS 3020 counter/timers has been
updated to work with versions 3 and 4 of the device firmware.
.SH "December 13, 2010 \- RELEASE 5.09.01\-3"
.rs
.SH "New \fBgpib_par()\fP Command With \fB\(dqtimeout\(dq\fP Option"
.sp
A new
\fBgpib_par()\fP
command is available.
The only option currently available is
\fB"timeout"\fP,
which can be used to return or set the timeout value
for user\-level GPIB transfers.
See the
\fI\%gpib\fP help file for details.
.SH "User\-level GPIB Transfers Now Interruptible With \fB^C\fP"
.sp
The user\-level GPIB commands,
\fBgpib_get()\fP
and
\fBgpib_put()\fP,
can now be interrupted with
\fB^C\fP,
although only with GPIB controllers configured to use \fBspec\fP\(aqs
built\-in GPIB support (National Instruments PCI\-GPIB, AT\-GPIB,
PCII, PCIIA, GPIB\-ENET and Scientific Solutions IEEE\-488).
.SH "Fix For \fBmca_sel(\(dq?\(dq)\fP"
.sp
A bug, where the
\fBmca_sel("?")\fP
command could cause \fBspec\fP to crash when the hardware configuration included
a Canberra Multiport MCA with
more than one MCA submodule, has been fixed.
.SH "Fix For \fBsurf\fP Calculation"
.sp
An old bug (since 1986) in the
\fBsurf\fP
geometry code for calculating motor positions from reciprocal space
coordinates for negative
\fBL\fP
has been fixed.
.SH "Warning Message Suppressed For Restored Socket Connections"
.sp
When the user\-level
\fBsock_get()\fP
and
\fBsock_put()\fP
functions detect a dropped connection, \fBspec\fP automatically
attempts to restore the connection and complete the transaction.
Previously, \fBspec\fP would print a warning message when this happened.
Now the message is only printed if the print\-warning\-message debug
level is enabled.
However,
an error message will be printed if the connection could not be
restored.
.SH "Bug Fix and Updated Support For Mythen"
.sp
A bug where \fBspec\fP did not send updated values for the
threshold parameter for the Dectris Mythen 1K MCA
has been fixed.
In addition, preliminary support for the Mythen version 2.0 firmware
has been added.
See the
\fI\%mythen\fP help file for details.
.SH "Updated Support For Huber SMC 9300"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports the simultaneous start feature available on the
Huber SMC 9300 stepper motor controller with firmware at level 1.1.97 or
above.
In addition, when using the command pass\-through options of
\fB"read"\fP
and
\fB"send"\fP
with
\fBmotor_par()\fP,
\fBspec\fP will automatically insert the channel number to a
properly formatted command string.
Also, the standard optional motor parameter
\fB"deceleration"\fP
is now supported for the 9300.
.SH "Fix For Newport Agilis Motor Controller"
.sp
A formatting error in a command sent to the Newport Agilis
motor controller that generated spurious error messages on models with
newer firmware has been fixed.
The error was ignored on earlier versions of the Agilis firmware.
.SH "Preliminary Support For Bruker Vantec\-1 MCA"
.sp
This \fBspec\fP release has initial support for the Bruker Vantec\-1 MCA over a
Ethernet interface.
.SH "Preliminary Support For Physik Instrumente E\-816"
.sp
This \fBspec\fP release has initial support for the Physik Instrumente E\-816
piezo motor controller over a serial interface.
.SH "October 17, 2010 \- RELEASE 5.09.01\-2"
.rs
.SH "New \fBmca_par()\fP Options For Amptek PX4"
.sp
New
\fBmca_par()\fP
\fB"slow_counts"\fP
and
\fB"fast_counts"\fP
options are recognized for the Amptek PX4/DP5 support.
The
\fB"slow_counts"\fP
option is synonymous with
\fB"elapsed_counts"\fP.
See the
\fI\%px4\fP help file for details.
.SH "Fix For \fBtango_get()\fP With \(dqExtras\(dq"
.sp
A bug with the
\fBtango_get()\fP
feature that returns attribute information (such as data type and time stamp) in
an associative array passed as an optional third argument has been fixed.
Previously, use of that feature would likely corrupt \fBspec\fP\(aqs memory arena.
.SH "October 6, 2010 \- RELEASE 5.09.01\-1"
.rs
.SH "Multiple Master Timers Now Supported"
.sp
Preliminary support for multiple master timers is now available.
However, currently, for most hardware only one master
timer of a particular type is allowed.
(The EPICS
scaler record and macro\-hardware counters do now
support multipler masters of the same type.)
Support for multiple master timers of the same kind will be
added as needed and when feasible for additional controllers types.
When multiple master timers are configured, \fBspec\fP will program
each for the count interval and start each of them after enabling all
counters.
The functions that wait for the timer to finish will now wait
for all the configured timers to finish.
For counters and for MCA\- and CCD\-type devices configured in
\fB"auto_run"\fP
mode that
are not hardware gated
by a master timer, \fBspec\fP will halt those devices when the master timer
that appears first in the
\fBconfig\fP
file
reaches its preset.
.SH "Waiting For Acquisition\-type Devices Improved"
.sp
For acquisition devices (MCAs, CCDs) with
\fB"auto_run"\fP
mode enabled such that the devices
are started automatically during
counting,
waiting for counting with the
\fBwait()\fP
function will also include
waiting for those devices.
See the
\fI\%wait\fP help file.
.SH "\fBspec\fP Server Now Handles \fBdofile()\fP Sent From Client"
.sp
Previously, when the commands
\fBdofile()\fP
or
\fBqdofile()\fP
(or macros that invoke the commands) were sent by a client
as commands to be executed by a \fBspec\fP server,
the command files wouldn\(aqt be read until a newline was typed
at the server keyboard.
That limitation has now been removed.
.SH "\fBspec\fP Server Now Handles \fBreconfig\fP and \fBsavstate\fP Sent From Client"
.sp
Previously, the
\fBreconfig\fP
and
\fBsavstate\fP
commands were not supported when sent from a client to a \fBspec\fP
server.
Those commands are now available.
.SH "Increased Maximum Number of Motors"
.sp
When the maximum number of motors was last increased
(November 2003), it was mentioned that when a user hit the new limit of
200 motors, the code would be revised to remove any limit.
Well, a user has hit the new limit, but the code rewrite will be deferred
in order to more quickly release a version with a new maximum number of
motors.
The new maximum is 256 motors.
.SH "\fBspec\fP Will Continue When Too Many Motors Or Counters Are Configured"
.sp
Previously, if more than the maximum number of motors or
counters was configured, \fBspec\fP would abort hardware configuration.
Now, \fBspec\fP will complete hardware configuration and simply ignore
the configuration of motors or counters beyond the maximum allowed.
.SH "New \fBser_par() drain\fP Option"
.sp
A new
\fB"drain"\fP
option to the
\fBser_par()\fP
function will cause \fBspec\fP to delay until
all output written to the associated serial device has been transmitted.
The call only works on built\-in
\fBLinux\fP
or
UNIX
serial ports.
See the
\fI\%serial\fP help file for details.
.SH "Updated USB Support On \fBLinux\fP"
.sp
On
\fBLinux\fP
platforms, \fBspec\fP now supports the
\fBudev\fP
(dynamic device management) method for accessing USB devices.
The
\fBusbfs\fP
(also known as
\fBusbdevfs\fP)
file system method remains supported for older
\fBLinux\fP
distributions.
In addition, if linked with the
\fBlibusb\fP
library (currently only the 0.1 version is supported),
\fBspec\fP will use that.
For using
\fBudev\fP
method on
\fBLinux\fP
platforms, a
\fBspec_usb.rules\fP
file is now included in the \fBspec\fP distribution that can be copied to
\fB/etc/udev/rules.d\fP.
That file contains permissive permission configurations for all
\fBspec\fP\-supported USB hardware.
When the system starts up, device permissions will be set so that
all users can access the specified USB devices.
.SH "Fix For Reconnecting To \fBextern\fP Shared Arrays"
.sp
A bug, where
a second
\fBextern shared array\fP
declaration for the same array could generate a segmentation
fault, has been fixed.
The bug had been
introduced with a shared\-array fix for a different problem
in \fBspec\fP release 5.08.01\-1.
.SH "Fix For Crash With Certain Motor Controller Configurations"
.sp
A bug, which resulted in a segmentation fault under certain
conditions on certain platforms,
has been fixed.
The crash could occur if a channel number was equal to
the number of channels configured for an
EPICS motor controller (or three other little\-used
controller types:  AGILIS, FC501A, IPS).
The crash occurred on
\fBreconfig\fP
or on exiting \fBspec\fP and was only seen on Solaris
platforms.
.SH "Recent Baud Rate Updates Now Working"
.sp
Some of the baud\-rate related updates announced in
\fBspec\fP release 5.08.06\-4 that weren\(aqt quite working
are now fixed.
In particular, setting non\-standard baud rates of
7200, 14400 and 28800 now works on
\fBLinux\fP
platforms, and the
\fB"baud"\fP
option to
\fBser_par()\fP
now correctly returns the baud rate.
In addition, using
\fBser_par()\fP
to change the baud rate will now print a fail message
and return \-1 if the change was ineffective, which can
happen, for example, if the underlying driver does not support
the requested rate.
.SH "\fBscan_tail\fP Now Included In \fBtimescan\fP and \fBloopscan\fP Macros"
.sp
The
\fB_timescan\fP
macro, which contains most of the code for the
\fBtimescan\fP
and
\fBloopscan\fP
macros, now includes a call of the standard
\fBscan_tail\fP
macro, which, by default is defined as
\fB_tail\fP.
That macro calls various user hook macros, does end\-of\-scan plotting,
and clears the scan\-active bit of the
\fB_stype\fP
variable.
.SH "Fixes For \fBstartup\fP and \fBsave\fP Macros For Geometry\-less Configurations"
.sp
The
\fBno_hkl\fP
macro, invoked automatically in the standard macros for the
geometry\-less
\fBspec\fP
configuration, now properly defines null macros for the
\fBstartgeo\fP
and
\fBsavegeo\fP
which allows the standard
\fBstartup\fP
and
\fBsave\fP
macros to work when no geometry is included in the configuration.
.SH "The \fBgetscan\fP Macro Fixed To Work With Plotting"
.sp
The
\fBgetscan\fP
macro now updates the global
\fB"last\-data\-point"\fP
symbol
\fBLDT\fP
to accommodate the plotting macros in the
\fBplotarray.mac\fP
file.
.SH "Fix For \fBshowUB\fP and \fBenterUB\fP Macros"
.sp
A 13\-year old bug where the
\fBshowUB\fP
and
\fBenterUB\fP
macros had the rows displayed as columns has been fixed.
.SH "Bug In TACO Error Reporting Fixed"
.sp
A bug, where TACO errors associated with the built\-in support
for TACO devices would not be displayed after calls of
the user\-level
\fBtaco_io()\fP
function when either of the global variable
\fBTACO_ERR\fP
or
\fBESRF_ERR\fP
was set to \-1, has been fixed.
.SH "Faster EPICS Monitor Checks"
.sp
The overhead associated with the
\fB"monitor_check"\fP
option to an
\fBepics_par()\fP
call has been decreased from
0.01 seconds per call to something much less.
.SH "Less Overhead For EPICS Scaler and PV Counters"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now uses callback events to keep track of
values for EPICS scalers and PV counters.
Previously, \fBspec\fP used channel access gets to retrieve
the values when the
\fBgetcounts\fP
command was executed.
The callback method should decrease per\-point overhead
during scans.
.SH "Fix For \fBwait(8)\fP For EPICS Motor Connections"
.sp
The documentation for the
\fBwait()\fP
built\-in function says that if bit 3 of the optional argument
is set, the function will wait for
connections from \fBspec\fP servers and EPICS remote motors.
The behavior
was broken with respect to testing for EPICS motors,
but has now been fixed.
.SH "Updates and Fixes For Dectris Mythen Support"
.sp
Several issues with the initial support for the Dectris
Mythen 1K MCA have been addressed.
The current \fBspec\fP support
is for Mythen firmware up to version 1.3.
.SH "New Check For Reset With Trinamic Motor Controllers"
.sp
When power is cycled on the Trinamic motor controllers, a
number of parameters need reprogramming.
Otherwise, wild and unexpected movements may occur.
Although one should never cycle the power on hardware controllers
while \fBspec\fP is running, the Trinamic controllers do have a
status flag that allows software to detect when the power has
been cycled.
A new option will have
\fBspec\fP check this flag at intervals and reprogram the
controller parameters if a power cycle is detected.
See the
\fI\%trinamic\fP help file for details.
.SH "Fix For Canberra Lynx (DSA\-3000) MCA"
.sp
A bug which broke the support for the Canberra Lynx (DSA\-3000) MCA
on some platforms has been fixed.
In addition, the \fBspec\fP support has been updated to work with the current
release of the Lynx firmware.
.SH "Updated PX4 Support For DP5"
.sp
The support for the Amptek PX4 MCA has been updated to work with the
new model DP5 (using its PX4 compatibility mode).
Support for the additional DP5 features will be added to \fBspec\fP soon.
.SH "Fix For Multiport MCA Support Over GPIB"
.sp
A timeout problem when reading large data sets over GPIB from the
Canberra/Oxford/Tennelec/Nucleus Multiport MCA has been
fixed.
