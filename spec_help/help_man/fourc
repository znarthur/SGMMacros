.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.rs
.sp
\fBfourc\fP version of \fBspec\fP operates a standard four\-circle diffractometer.
These notes give a brief description of the features of \fBfourc\fP.
Further details are given
in the \fBFour\-Circle Reference\fP section of the \fBspec\fP manual.
.SH "FOUR\-CIRCLE MODES"
.rs
.sp
The four\-circle modes represent the various constraints that
can be made on the transformation equations from reciprocal
space to diffractometer angles.
Use the \fBsetmode\fP macro to select a four\-circle mode.
The different modes are numbered as follows:
.sp
.RS 4m
.TS
;
l l .
0	Omega Equals Zero
1	Omega Fixed
2	Zone (Chi and Phi Fixed)
3	Phi Fixed
4	Azimuthal
5	Alpha Fixed
6	Beta Fixed
.TE
.RE
.SH "FROZEN ANGLES"
.rs
.sp
Each of the four\-circle modes has associated an angle (or angles)
that are fixed in that mode.
As a convenience, there is a \fBfreeze\fP macro that turns on a \fBfrozen\fP mode.
When in frozen mode, all moves that specify reciprocal space coordinates
will use the frozen value(s) of the current mode\(aqs fixed angle(s).
Thus you can move motors around for lining up, etc, but have the the
fixed parameter automatically restored
to the frozen value when doing reciprocal space
scans, \fBbr\fP moves, etc.  The \fBunfreeze\fP macro turns frozen mode off.
.sp
The frozen values are stored in variables (actually macros) named
\fBF_OMEGA\fP (omega\-fixed mode),
\fBF_CHI_Z\fP and
\fBF_PHI_Z\fP (zone mode),
\fBF_PHI\fP (phi\-fixed mode),
\fBF_AZIMUTH\fP (azimuthal mode),
\fBF_ALPHA\fP (alpha\-fixed mode),
and
\fBF_BETA\fP (beta\-fixed mode).
You can, of course, assign values to these variables by hand.
.SH "FOUR\-CIRCLE SECTORS"
.rs
.sp
The sector transformations are symmetry operations on the
diffractometer angles that yield eight different
positions of the diffractometer circles that correspond to the same
\fBH\fP, \fBK\fP and \fBL\fP position. A ninth sector
minimizes \fBabs(chi \- 90)\fP and \fBabs(phi)\fP.
The \fBsectors H K L\fP
macro prints the diffractometer angles that would be used for each
of the possible sectors for a particular reciprocal space position.
Use the \fBsetsector\fP macro to select a sector.
.SH "CUT POINTS"
.rs
.sp
Cut points affect the direction the diffractometer circles turn to get from
one position to the next.  For example,
if a cut point is at zero, the corresponding circle will only move through
angles of 0 to 360 degrees.  Thus, to get from 355 (=\-5) to 5 degrees,
the circle will turn 350 degrees.
If a cut point is at \-180, the circle will move through angles from \-180 to 180.
Thus the same motion from \-5 to 5 will require only 10 degrees of movement.
Use the \fBcuts\fP macro to select cut points for \fBtheta\fP, \fBchi\fP and
\fBphi\fP (and the \fBazimuth\fP).
The \fBtwo\-theta\fP motor always uses \-180 as a cut point.
(Only the sign of the \fBazimuth\fP cut point is used,
and it determines the sign of the \fBazimuth\fP angle.)
.SH "LATTICE PARAMETERS"
.rs
.sp
The \fBsetlat\fP and \fBsetrlat\fP macros
let you set the lattice parameters in direct space or reciprocal space,
respectively.
.SH "ORIENTATION MATRIX"
.rs
.sp
With known lattice parameters, you need to find two
(nonparallel) reflections in order to determine the orientation matrix.
The macros \fBor0 H K L\fP and
\fBor1 H K L\fP
are used to associate the current diffractometer angles with the primary
and secondary reflections.  Macros called \fBsetor0\fP and
\fBsetor1\fP also let you set the orientation reflections, but
don\(aqt require you to move the diffractometer to the correct position.
Instead, you are prompted for each of the angles and values for
\fBH\fP, \fBK\fP and \fBL\fP. The \fBor_swap\fP macro is available
to exchange the primary and secondary reflections.
.sp
You can also fit an orientation matrix if you have three or more
known reflections
(not all in the same plane), but unknown lattice parameters.  Use
\fBreflex_beg\fP to initialize a reflections data file.  Use
\fBreflex H K L\fP
to add the current reflection to the file.  Use \fBreflex_end\fP
to complete the file.
You then run the reflections file as a \fBspec\fP command file in order to
fit the reflections to obtain a new orientation matrix.
To calculate lattice parameters from the new orientation matrix, type
\fBcalcL\fP. You can then display the lattice parameters with the \fBpa\fP macro.
Naturally, you can edit the reflections data file to delete or modify
any of the reflection data there.
