Typing
\fBscan_on\fP
continues a scan that was aborted.
Presently,
\fBmesh\fP
scans cannot be restarted.
Also restarted delta scans
(\fBlup\fP
\fBdscan\fP
and
\fBd2scan\fP)
will not return the scanned motors to the center position
after the restarted portion of the scan completes.
.sp
Four\-circle users may now assign cut points for angles
set by the geometry calculation code.
The macro
\fBcuts\fP
does the assignment.
Presently, cut points are used with
\fBth\fP,
\fBphi\fP,
\fBchi\fP
and
\fBomega\fP.
The user specifies the lesser cut point in degrees
(integers only), and the angles will
be set between that point and that point plus 360 degrees.
The
\fBazimuth\fP
has a pseudo\-cut point.
If its value is less than zero, the
calculated azimuth will be between \-180 and 0,
otherwise the azimuth will be between 0 and +180.
.sp
This release supports the old VENIX operating system on PDP 11/73
computers.
See the
\fBpdp\fP
help file.
