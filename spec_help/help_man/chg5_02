.SH "March 2, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.02.04\-9"
.rs
.SH "Fix For Parsing Of \fBvme_xxx()\fP Options"
.sp
An old bug, where a single argument containing a comma\-separated
list of options
for the
\fBvme_get()\fP,
\fBvme_put()\fP,
\fBvme_get32()\fP,
\fBvme_put32()\fP
and
\fBvme_move()\fP
functions wasn\(aqt parsed correctly, has been fixed.
Options contained in a comma\-separated list of arguments were not
a problem.
.SH "Fix For ESRF TACO MAXE Motor Limits"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now recognizes the case where a motor interfaced using the ESRF
TACO MAXE device server has both limits active.
Previously, only the case where one limit was active
was recognized.
.SH "February 21, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.02.04\-8"
.rs
.SH "New \fBarray_op()\fP Option"
.sp
The
\fB"sum"\fP
and
\fB"sumsq"\fP
options of
\fBarray_op()\fP
can now take a third argument to specify a frame size for return
values that are arrays of sums of elements.
See the
\fI\%arrays\fP help file for details.
.SH "Support For Struck SIS1100/3100 PCI to VME"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports the Struck model SIS1100/3100 PCI to VME bus
coupler on
\fBLinux\fP
platforms.
.SH "Fix For Channel Numbering For PI C\-804"
.sp
An off\-by\-one numbering problem for the the Physik Instrumente C\-804
motor controller, introduced in \fBspec\fP release 5.01.01, has been fixed.
.SH "February 11, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.02.04\-7"
.rs
.SH "Crash On Certain Array Errors Fixed"
.sp
A bug introduced in \fBspec\fP release 5.02.03, where the error messages
that were to be displayed on certain array operations
(divide by zero or an assignment of an array to a scaler) instead produced
segmentation faults on certain platforms, has been fixed.
.SH "February 6, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.02.04\-6"
.rs
.SH "New Debug Option For Socket I/O"
.sp
If the bit 0x400000 is added to the global
\fBDEBUG\fP
level when bit 0x40 (hardware debugging) is also set, the
messages sent and received over sockets will be displayed in an
all\-hexadecimal format, rather than the normal ASCII with backslash
escapes for non\-printable characters.
.SH "Shared Memory Fix For HP Platforms"
.sp
One of the shared memory improvements in \fBspec\fP release 5.02.01\-1
apparently resulted in a bug on HP platforms, in that shared memory
segments created within one \fBspec\fP process would not be visible
to other processes.
That problem has been corrected, although
the automatic deletion
of shared segments is back to its pre\-release 5.02.01\-1 level of
robustness for HP platforms.
.SH "February 3, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.02.04\-5"
.rs
.SH "Obscure \fBeval()\fP Bug Fixed"
.sp
An obscure bug, where the usage
\fBeval("#")\fP
would cause \fBspec\fP to crash,
has been fixed.
.SH "MCS Support For Seiko EG&G MCA 7700"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports multichannel scaling on the Seiko EG&G MCA 7700
device.
New arguments for
\fBmca_par()\fP
to support MCS mode
are
\fB"mcs"\fP
to set multichannel scaling mode,
\fB"dwell"\fP
to set the dwell time (with a value of \-1 setting external dwell),
\fB"passes"\fP
to set the number of MCS passes
and
\fB"elapsed_passes"\fP
to read the numbers of MCS passes completed.
.SH "Retry Feature For EPICS Reads"
.sp
This version of \fBspec\fP will retry EPICS channel\-access reads that
fail with a timeout.
The new
\fB"retries"\fP
argument to
\fBepics_par()\fP
can be used to read or set the number of retries.
Although a process variable name must be provided to
\fBepics_par()\fP,
the setting is currently global to all process variables.
The default value is two, and the default is restored each time
\fBspec\fP is run.
Messages will be printed when the channel access reads are retried.
Users are requested to inform CSS if retries prove successful (or not).
.SH "February 2, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.02.04\-4"
.rs
.SH "Some Obscure Memory\-Related Bugs Fixed"
.sp
A couple of problems that caused memory faults on some platforms,
related to the display of help files with \fBspec\fP\(aqs built\-in pager and
the release of shared arrays when \fBspec\fP quits, have been fixed.
.SH "January 30, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.02.04\-3"
.rs
.SH "Fix For \fBedconf\fP Configuration Editor"
.sp
A bug in the
\fBedconf\fP
hardware configuration editor, where a motor\(aqs unit/channel
information would be lost when a motor was inserted or
deleted and adjacent motor columns did not have unit/channel information
turned on, has been fixed.
.SH "New Feature For the \fBedconf\fP Configuration Editor"
.sp
When in the list menus of the
\fBedconf\fP
hardware configuration editor,
typing a letter will scroll to
the first item in the menu that begins with that letter.
The letters are case insensitive.
However, the command characters
\fBj\fP
and
\fBk\fP
are still recognized as moves down and up, respectively.
However, typing
\fBJ\fP
or
\fBK\fP
will cause a jump to the items matching those letters.
.SH "January 27, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.02.04\-2"
.rs
.SH "Fix For Four GPIB Controllers"
.sp
A bug that prevented GPIB controller unit four from being recognized
has been fixed.
.SH "Word Access for ISA DAC Motors"
.sp
ISA digital\-to\-analog modules can now be configured for either byte or
word access.
Previously, only byte access was used.
Also, see the new
\fI\%dac\fP help file for a description of the DAC motor interface.
.SH "Fixes For Recent Update To ESRF TACO Maxe Motor Controller Support"
.sp
Problems with excessive hardware reads
in the revised Maxe code included in \fBspec\fP
release 5.02.03\-4 have been fixed.
.SH "January 17, 2003 \- RELEASE 5.02.04\-1"
.rs
.SH "\fBnewfile\fP Macro Fix"
.sp
The
\fBnewfile\fP
macro will now write the
\fB#F\fP
control line that contains the file name
for new data files, no matter
what the starting scan number is.
Previously, the file name was only written for new files when the
starting scan was number one.
.SH "Fix For Geometry\-less Installations"
.sp
The installation procedure will now create a start\-up command file
for the
\fBspec\fP\-type
geometry\-less configurations that aren\(aqt named
\fBspec\fP.
The start\-up file will be named with the first four letters of the
configuration name, appended with
\fB.mac\fP
and contain a call of the
\fBno_hkl\fP
macro.
.SH "Updated MXC Hardware Support"
.sp
Support for the Bruker (formerly MAC Science) MXC motor controllers and
counter/timers has been updated to work with another version of the
controller.
.SH "ESRF UDP Transfer Size Increased"
.sp
The maximum data size for
\fBesrf_io()\fP
UDP transfers has been increased from 8,192 to 32,768 bytes.
.SH "December 12, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.04"
.rs
.SH "Pseudomotor Improvements"
.sp
The
\fBset\fP
macro now works with
pseudomotors.
For the kind of pseudomotor where the motor position is calculated from
the positions of one or more real motors, such
as with the
\fBkappa\fP
configurations of the
\fBfourc\fP
or
\fBpsic\fP
geometries,
the
\fBchg_offset()\fP
function, as called by
\fBset\fP,
will now automatically adjust the offsets of the real motors
on which the pseudomotor depends.
\fBspec\fP also now enforces the rule that
for this type of
pseudomotor
the user and dial positions must be the same.
Thus, the
\fBchg_dial()\fP
function, as used in the
\fBset_dial\fP
macro, will produce an error if an attempt is made to change
the pseudomotor dial position.
Note, the definitions of the
\fBset\fP
and
\fBset_dial\fP
macros have been modified as part of the update.
.SH "December 5, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.03\-6"
.rs
.SH "Fix For MM4005/4006 Limit Search"
.sp
A bug, where negative limit searches on Newport MM4005/4006
motors controllers didn\(aqt work, has been fixed.
.SH "November 22, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.03\-5"
.rs
.SH "New Signal Handling On Exit"
.sp
\fBspec\fP\(aqs exit behavior on receiving the signals
SIGTERM (the default signal sent with
the
\fBkill\fP
command)
and SIGQUIT (the signal sent with a keyboard
\fB^\e\fP,
at least on most platforms) has been changed.
Previously, \fBspec\fP would wait for the current
moving and counting to finish, or wait for
an additional
signal, such as a SIGINT from a keyboard
\fB^C\fP,
that would stop the acquisition.
Now \fBspec\fP will halt the hardware activity when the first signal arrives.
Also, \fBspec\fP now catches SIGHUP (the hang\-up signal,
as sent by a window manager
when the window manager exits) and halts hardware activity
as with SIGQUIT and SIGTERM.
\fBspec\fP will save the user state file on SIGHUP, but still will not with
SIGQUIT and SIGTERM.
.SH "Fix For \fBeval()\fP"
.sp
A bug, where an
\fBeval()\fP
call of a macro function that contained a loop that called a macro function
that had no return value and where that call would cause the loop to break
after one iteration,
has been fixed.
.SH "Fix For Motor Round Off"
.sp
An obscure bug with motor position rounding has been fixed.
With certain step size values, if the user\-position
offset was set to exactly one half step beyond the configured step size,
under some conditions, such a motor would move a
step when other motors were commanded to move.
.SH "November 20, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.03\-4"
.rs
.SH "Motor Power Control For Tsuji Controllers"
.sp
If the optional motor parameter
\fB"generic parameter 1"\fP
is set for a Tsuji PM16C\-02/04 motor channel, \fBspec\fP will issue
commands to turn the motor hold current off when the motor is not moving.
The parameter value is the delay time (in seconds) both between
the time the power is turned on and the move is started and between
the end of the move and the time the power is turned off.
A value of zero will skip the delay.
If the field in the configuration editor is blank (type
\fB^D\fP
to blank the field),
then the motor hold current will remain on all the time.
.SH "New Version for ESRF TACO Maxe Motor Controllers"
.sp
The code to support the ESRF TACO Maxe motor controllers has been
reorganized as part of a modernization effort.
Functionality should remain as before, but if anomalies are noticed,
please contact your \fBspec\fP administrator or CSS HQ.
.SH "November 18, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.03\-3"
.rs
.SH "Fix For \fBx11filt\fP Fonts"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now accepts a parameter of either
\fBc\fP
(character cell)
or
\fBm\fP
(monospace)
in the
\fBspacing\fP
field of the X Logical Font Descriptor (XLFD) string.
Previously, only
\fBm\fP
was accepted (unless overwritten by specific font choices using an
\fBXdefaults\fP
resource file or a
\fBplot_cntl()\fP
call).
.SH "October 26, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.03\-2"
.rs
.SH "Support For \fBpsic\fP Azimuthal Detector Rotation"
.sp
\fBspec\fP will now calculate detector rotation in the
\fBpsic\fP
geometry according to the E. Vlieg 2+3 diffractometer configuration.
See the
\fI\%psic\fP help file for more information.
.SH "Support For Parallel\-Rail 3\-Axis Four\-Circle Geometry"
.sp
The
\fBfourc\fP
geometry code now includes preliminary support for a new configuration
that has monochromator, sample circles, analyzer and detector
circles mounted on four parallel rails, perpendicular to the
incident beam.
See the
\fBgeo_fourc.c\fP
and
\fBmacros/fourc.src\fP
files for additional information.
.SH "Updated Geometry Code"
.sp
The remaining geometry code
has been revised to use the current \fBspec\fP
convention of returning an error rather than resetting to command
level when a calculation fails.
The affected geometries in this revision are
\fBgmci\fP,
\fBs2d2\fP,
\fBsurf\fP,
\fBtwoc\fP,
\fBw21h\fP
and
\fBw21v\fP.
(The other geometries were updated in prior releases.)
Also, the standard macros
\fBbr\fP,
\fBmk\fP,
\fBca\fP
and
\fBcal\fP
have been revised to exit if the function call embedded in the
\fBcalcA\fP
macro (to calculate motor positions given the
\fBHKL\fP
of the scattering vector)
fails.
.SH "Support For Velmex VXM Motor Controllers"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports the Velmex, Inc. VXM\-1 and VXM\-2 motor controllers
over a serial interface.
.SH "Support For IMS MDrive Motor Controllers"
.sp
\fBspec\fP contains preliminary support for Intelligent Motion Systems, Inc.
MDrive 17/23/34 motor controllers over a serial interface.
.SH "Upgrade to Gomm Controllers"
.sp
The code for the Uni\-Erlangen Gomm motor and counter controllers
now supports controllers on more than one serial line.
.SH "October 20, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.03\-1"
.rs
.SH "Fix and Enhancement For Rigaku Controllers"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now works properly with a variant firmware version in a Rigaku
RINT or D/MAX type motor controller.
Rigaku version numbers are unknown.
The manifestation of the problem was that motor positions weren\(aqt read
correctly during or just after a move.
That problem is fixed.
Also, Rigaku firmware has never allowed a remote program to read motor
positions while motors are moving.
\fBspec\fP will now estimate the current position based on
motor speed and acceleration and display the estimated position during
updated moves.
.SH "October 13, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.03"
.rs
.SH "Fix For \fBarray_dump()\fP and \fBarray_pipe()\fP"
.sp
A bug introduced in release 5.01.01 (as an unintended consequence of
another fix), which limited the output of
\fBarray_dump()\fP
and
\fBarray_pipe()\fP
to 64 columns of the array argument, has been fixed.
.SH "Improved \fB^C\fP Responsiveness During Array Printing"
.sp
A
\fB^C\fP
interrupt during output of a large data array with the
\fBprint\fP
command will now
more likely stop the output.
.SH "New \fBmotor_par()\fP Options To Set Limits"
.sp
The new options
\fB"low_limit"\fP
and
\fB"high_limit"\fP
are available to set and retrieve motor limits.
The
\fBset_lim()\fP
and
\fBget_lim()\fP
built\-in functions continue to be available.
.SH "Fix For Very Large Arrays"
.sp
A recently introduced bug, where a negative data array dimension in
an
\fBarray\fP
declaration would
be interpreted as a very large number rather than produce an error,
has been fixed.
.SH "New Command Character in \fBedconf\fP"
.sp
The double quote character
\fB"\fP
is now recognized by the configuration editor
\fBedconf\fP
as equivalent to the single quote character
\fB\(aq\fP
as a command to begin string\-entry mode.
.SH "September 30, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.02\-12"
.rs
.SH "Fix For Compumotor 3000 and 4000 Motor Controllers"
.sp
A bug, where \fBspec\fP could segmentation fault when trying to
use the old Compumotor CM3000 or CM4000 motor controllers
with recent versions of the National Instruments
GPIB driver,
has been fixed.
.SH "September 20, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.02\-11"
.rs
.SH "Fix For Detecting EPICS Motor Configuration Error"
.sp
A bug, where \fBspec\fP could segmentation fault when EPICS motors were
configured on the Motor screen of the configuration editor but
the number of motors on the Devices screen was zero, has been fixed.
.SH "Fix For Setting TACO Serial Line Parity"
.sp
A bug, where \fBspec\fP didn\(aqt adjust the number of data bits from eight
to seven
on the TACO
serial line driver when setting parity to even or odd, has been fixed.
.SH "September 6, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.02\-10"
.rs
.SH "Bug In Serial and Socket EOS\-mode Reads Fixed"
.sp
A bug introduced in release 5.02.02 (May 20, 2002),
where when
reading serial devices in end\-of\-string (EOS) mode,
a false EOS match was sometimes reported, has been fixed.
The bug affected both built\-in hardware code and user\-level
\fBser_get()\fP
and
\fBsock_get()\fP
functions.
.SH "September 2, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.02\-9"
.rs
.SH "Plot Ranging Bug Fixed"
.sp
A bug, where the high\-resolution plotting in \fBspec\fP would hang
on certain platforms or display peculiar axis labels on others
if all the data points for the
\fBx\fP
or
\fBy\fP
axis were an identical very large number (such as 1e38),
has been fixed.
.SH "Newport MM4000/4005/4006 Updates"
.sp
A number of fixes and updates have been made for the Newport
MM4000/4005/4006 motor controller support.
For the 4005/4006, the commands (unavailable on the 4000)
to set the base rate, the
home base rate and the home acceleration are now implemented.
Also, it is now possible to set the dial (home) position to an
arbitrary value on all three models.
An alternate home command (generally
\fB"OR2"\fP),
rather than the default
\fB"OR1"\fP
can be selected by entering the command as Generic Parameter 1 on
the second optional motor parameter screen of the configuration editor.
Also, limit searches are now properly implemented
on the 4005 and 4006 models (although
unavailable on the 4000 model).
In addition, problems with doing a move
after hitting a hard limit have been fixed.
Finally, the settle\-time feature is now supported with these controllers.
.SH "August 21, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.02\-8"
.rs
.SH "Shared Memory Fix For Solaris Platforms"
.sp
One of the shared memory improvements in \fBspec\fP release 5.02.01\-1
resulted in a bug on Solaris platforms, in that shared memory
segments created within one \fBspec\fP process would not be visible
to other processes.
That problem has been corrected, although for Solaris platforms only,
the automatic deletion
of shared segments is back to its pre\-release 5.02.01\-1 level of
robustness.
.SH "August 11, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.02\-7"
.rs
.SH "MCA Interface Additions"
.sp
A new
\fBMCAS\fP
global variable is available that is set to the total number of
configured MCA devices.
The
\fBmca_sel()\fP
function can return one line of information about a particular MCA using
the syntax
\fBmca_sel(n, "?")\fP,
where
\fBn\fP
is the MCA device number.
.SH "Update to Roentec MCA Support"
.sp
A couple of features have been added to
the Roentec XFlash MAX MCA support.
The device can now be configured to run at any baud rate.
Previously, the reset command sent by \fBspec\fP would reset the baud rate
to 38400.
A new
\fBmca_par()\fP
option
\fB"bin"\fP
can be used to set the number of channels averaged together within the
device during the data read out.
For hardware configurations that support live\-time presets and readouts,
the standard live\-time and dead\-time
\fBmca_par()\fP
commands are now available.
.SH "Support For Ortec MCS\-PCI Multichannel Scaler"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports the Ortec MCS\-PCI multichannel scaler module.
See the
\fI\%mcspci\fP help file for details.
.SH "Help Display Bugs Fix"
.sp
A bug introduced in release 5.01.03,
where display of a long
help file using either the
\fBgethelp()\fP
function or the
\fBchelp\fP
shell utility
would cause a segmentation fault
on some platforms, has been fixed.
Also, the
\fBb\fP
command to move backwards a page when using the built\-in pager
was left out of that release, but is now restored.
.SH "July 23, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.02\-6"
.rs
.SH "Fix For Macro Functions Returning Arrays"
.sp
A bug remaining from the release 5.02.02\-2
fixes for data arrays used with macro functions has been fixed.
Specifically,
a macro function can now return a data array declared as a local
in the macro function without causing a
segmentation fault or bad values in the returned array.
.SH "Fix For Plot Macro Setup"
.sp
A bug in the plot macros, where
the
\fBSCAN_D\fP
data array would not be configured correctly
if the symbol did not already exist as a two\-dimensional
array, has been fixed.
.SH "July 16, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.02\-5"
.rs
.SH "Extern Shared Array Fix"
.sp
A bug, where declaring an
\fBextern shared array\fP
more than once for the same array would result in a segmentation fault,
has been fixed.
.SH "July 10, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.02\-4"
.rs
.SH "Fix For IMS Controllers"
.sp
A bug introduced in \fBspec\fP release 5.01.03 that broke
party\-line mode for IMS motor controllers has been fixed.
.SH "July 3, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.02\-3"
.rs
.SH "Support For Ortec 996 Counter/Timer"
.sp
The Ortec 996 one\-channel counter/timer is now supported in \fBspec\fP as
either a single channel counter or a single channel counter with
blind timer.
See the
\fI\%ortec\fP help file for details.
.SH "Fix For Setting EPICS Timeout"
.sp
It is now possible to set the timeout value for an EPICS process variable
using
\fBepics_par()\fP
before connecting to the variable in the remote IOC.
Previously, the timeout could be set only after the connection
was made, which would be impossible if the default timeout was too short
to make the connection.
.SH "Fix For Setting TACO Timeout"
.sp
An old bug that affected setting the RPC timeout for TACO (ESRF) device
server connections has been fixed.
The bug had little impact except when attempting to set a timeout of less
than one second.
.SH "June 21, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.02\-2"
.rs
.SH "Fixes For Macro Functions With Data Arrays"
.sp
Bugs in recent \fBspec\fP releases involving
memory leaks and memory corruption errors
when passing data arrays to macro functions as arguments
or from macro functions as return values appear to be fixed.
Also, behavior when passing subarrays as macro function arguments
is now well defined.
A subarray will be passed by value.
That is, new memory will be allocated for the
data, and modifications to the data won\(aqt change the array in the
calling function.
.SH "Support For OMS Servo\-Motor Controllers"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now includes preliminary support for OMS servo\-motor controllers.
Select motor type
\fBOMS_S\fP
in the
\fBconfig\fP
editor.
The optional DC\-motor parameters for proportional, derivative and integral
gain (KP, KD and KI) are implemented.
Selecting the servo\-motor type automatically enables encoder capability.
.SH "June 2, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.02\-1"
.rs
.SH "New Ignore\-Simulate Mode For Sockets"
.sp
To accommodate the client\-server macros, sockets can now be
made immune to simulate mode with the new
\fB"ignore_sim"\fP
option to
\fBsock_par()\fP.
See the
\fI\%sockets\fP help file for usage.
The macros in
\fBserver.mac\fP
have been modified to use this new mode.
.SH "May 20, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.02"
.rs
.SH "Memory Leaks Fixed"
.sp
A number of small memory leaks have been fixed.
A
leak that occurred when command file input was interrupted
by an error or
\fB^C\fP
has been fixed.
A leak that occurred
when a macro function was used and then redefined within a
statement block has been fixed.
A leak that occurred when a data subarray was passed
to a macro function as an argument has been fixed.
.SH "Improvements To the \fBunglobal\fP Command"
.sp
Several improvements and fixes have made in the behavior of
\fBunglobal\fP
command.
Use of
\fBunglobal\fP
within a statement block will now clear the current values of symbols and
mark them as unset.
Use of
\fBunglobal\fP
on a
\fBconstant\fP
symbol within a statement block will remove the
\fBconstant\fP
attribute.
Use of
\fBunglobal\fP
in a macro function on a data array passed as an argument will clear
the values in the array to zero, but will not remove the array.
.SH "\fBclone()\fP Improvement"
.sp
The
\fBclone()\fP
function can now be used to redefine an existing macro.
.SH "Looping Bug In \fBeval()\fP Fixed"
.sp
A bug that caused an endless stream of error messages when the
\fBeval()\fP
function was passed an unterminated string has been fixed.
.SH "General Improvements To \fBeval()\fP"
.sp
A significant code rearrangement to create separate data structures
for each
\fBeval()\fP
invocation should increase the robustness of the function.
.SH "Fix Of \fBfor (var in arr)\fP Syntax"
.sp
A bug, where the
\fBfor (var in arr[num])\fP
syntax didn\(aqt properly loop through the elements of the two\-dimensional
associative array when
\fBnum\fP
was a number constant, has been fixed.
.SH "Array Alignment Extended"
.sp
The automatic array alignment to put the start of data on memory page
boundaries for arrays used with
\fBimage_get()\fP
and
\fBimage_put()\fP
has been extended.
Now all data arrays greater than 0.5 Mbyte will be aligned to a page
boundary when they are created.
.SH "Expanded Galil Motor Controller Support"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports the Galil Optima series motor controllers, including
the DMC\-2x00 models,
over ethernet and serial interfaces.
.SH "Fix For Four VME Controllers"
.sp
A bug that prevented VME controller unit four from being recognized
has been fixed.
.SH "Multiple Driver\-less SBS PCI Controllers Implemented"
.sp
\fBspec\fP can now support multiple (up to four)
SBS 616/617/618 PCI\-to\-VME bus adapters
in
\fB"driverless"\fP
mode on
\fBLinux\fP
platforms
In this mode, \fBspec\fP controls the PCI card directly, rather than going through
the kernel driver supplied by SBS.
.SH "Support For XIA X10P Parallel Port MCA"
.sp
\fBspec\fP now supports the XIA model X10P parallel Port MCA on
\fBLinux\fP
platforms.
.SH "Update To New XIA Libraries"
.sp
This release of \fBspec\fP requires linking with the current release
(0.0.6) of the
XIA libraries to use the DXP4C, DXP4C2X and the X10P modules.
.SH "May 2, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.01\-1"
.rs
.SH "New Optional Scaler Parameter Screen"
.sp
The configuration editor now includes a new screen to configure
optional scaler parameters.
The optional screen is accessed with the command
\fBs\fP
from the main Scaler screen.
Currently, the only optional scaler parameter used is for the
new EPICS process\-variable counters.
.SH "New EPICS Process\-Variable Counters"
.sp
Arbitrary EPICS process\-variables may now be configured as counters.
Their values will be read with the
\fBgetcounts\fP
command, called by the standard counting macros,
with the EPICS channel access get commands.
No other commands are issued.
The process\-variable name will be formed from the prefix given on the
Controllers screen of the configuration editor and the string
entered as miscellaneous
parameter 1 from the new optional Scaler parameter screen.
.SH "April 29, 2002 \- RELEASE 5.02.01"
.rs
.SH "Memory Alignment For \fBimage_get()\fP and \fBimage_put()\fP Data Arrays"
.sp
In order to accommodate image acquisition devices that transfer data
directly to memory and that require the data to be aligned on memory
page boundaries (memory addresses that are multiples of 4096),
data arrays used with the
\fBimage_get()\fP
and
\fBimage_put()\fP
functions
will now be
automatically aligned on memory page boundaries (in most cases).
.SH "Shared Array Updates"
.sp
A number of updates and improvements have been made to the shared array
facility:
.IP \(bu 2
The size of the header of the shared segment has been increased to
put the start of the data array on a page boundary to accommodate
acquisition hardware that requires page\-aligned data.
.IP \(bu 2
The new start\-up option
\fB\-o old_shared=1\fP
will tell \fBspec\fP to create shared segments using the old\-size headers
to accommodate
applications that have not yet been recompiled for the new header size.
.IP \(bu 2
The
\fBextern shared\fP
array feature can be used with both
old and new header sizes, even when using the
\fBold_shared\fP
option above.
.IP \(bu 2
Shared segments will automatically disappear when the
last attached process detaches or exits, even if \fBspec\fP exits abnormally.
Previously, \fBspec\fP only removed the segment when exiting normally.
.IP \(bu 2
If \fBspec\fP creates a shared array,
exits while another process is attached and
then restarts with the previous state file, \fBspec\fP
will reconnect to the existing array.
In prior releases, \fBspec\fP would always create a new segment.
.SH "New State File"
.sp
The state file format needed modification to accommodate the
array\-alignment feature, making the current state file
incompatible with previous releases.
The current \fBspec\fP version can
read state files from previous versions, but will write state files
that will not be readable by
previous \fBspec\fP versions.
.SH "Support For Alternate \fBtwoc\fP Configuration"
.sp
The
\fBgeo_twoc.c\fP
code has been modified to support an alternate configuration
where the
\fBth\fP
and
\fBtth\fP
rotations are coupled.
