.SH "INTRODUCTION"
.rs
.sp
The ASA\-32 is the ISA acquisition card for the Hecus SAX/SWAX X\-ray system.
The system has two detectors for obtaining both small\- and wide\-angle
data with the position\-sensitive detectors.
The system can be operated in a pure small\-angle (SAX) mode or
a multiplexed small/wide angle (SWAX) mode, where the time slots assigned
to each detector are independently adjustable from 0.01 to 2 seconds.
The ASA\-32 card can return both position and energy data for each of
the two detectors.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.rs
.sp
Since the MCA has two detectors and both energy
and position data arrays are available for each, the usual
numbering scheme in \fBspec\fP for selecting MCA devices has been extended.
To access other than the default detector (detector 1, the SAX detector)
or the default data (energy), the \fBmca_sget()\fP
and \fBmca_spar()\fP functions must be used rather than \fBmca_get()\fP and
\fBmca_par()\fP.
.sp
Normally, the first argument of \fBmca_sget()\fP
and \fBmca_spar()\fP selects which MCA device, when
more than one are configured.
The ASA\-32 is treated as one MCA device, but the first
argument usage is extended.  Instead of a simple number,
the first argument can be passed as a string that
contains first the number of the selected MCA, then a colon, then
a number that selects the detector and/or the type of data.
The lowest order hex digit of that second number is zero
for detector one or one for detector two.
The next hex digit is zero or one to code for energy or position,
respectively.  Decimal values are valid, too.  For example,
.sp
.RS 4m
.nf
.in +2
\fBmca_sget("0:0x10", data)\fP
.in -2
or

\fBmca_sget("0:16", data)\fP

or

\fBmca_sget("0:17", data)\fP

\fB"mplex_time"\fP,
\fB"energy_lower"\fP and \fB"energy_upper"\fP,

The standard MCA commands supported by \fBspec\fP are described in the
\fI\%mca\fP help file.
Of the standard functions, the ASA\-32 MCA supports
\fBmca_get()\fP but not \fBmca_put()\fP. The standard \fBmca_par()\fP options
\fB"info"\fP, \fB"chans"\fP, \fB"max_chans"\fP,
\fB"max_channels"\fP, \fB"disable"\fP, \fB"auto_run"\fP,
\fB"soft_preset"\fP, \fB"auto_clear"\fP, \fB"native_type"\fP,
\fB"preset"\fP, \fB"run"\fP, \fB"halt"\fP, and \fB"clear"\fP,
are supported by the ASA\-32 MCA.
.sp
For options that apply to the "selected detector",
detector 1 (the SAX detector) is selected by default, and
the \fBmca_spar()\fP first argument can be used to select detector 2,
as explained above.
