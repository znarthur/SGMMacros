DESCRIPTION

     ssppeecc provides a software environment for the operation of an X-ray
     diffractometer and other data-acquisition instruments.  ssppeecc contains a
     sophisticated command interpreter that uses a C-like grammar and is
     partially modeled on the standard UNIX utility aawwkk. ssppeecc supports a variety
     of X-ray diffractometer configurations.  The diffractometer geometry is
     chosen by the program name.  Some of the more popular geometries currently
     supported include:

         ssppeecc - General instrument control and data acquisition

         ffoouurrcc - Standard four-circle diffractometer

         ttwwoocc - Standard two-circle diffractometer

         ssiixxcc - Six-circle diffractometer (ddeellttaa, tthheettaa, cchhii, pphhii, mmuu, ggaammmmaa)

         kkaappppaa - kappa diffractometer

         ppssiicc - Psi-circle, including kappa type

         ssuurrff - Various liquid surface diffractometer configurations

     The following options are recognized:

         --ff - Fresh start.  All symbols are set to their default values and the
              standard macros are read to establish the default state.

         --FF - Clean and fresh start.  All symbols are set to their default
              values but no command files are read and no macros are defined.
              Only the built-in commands are available.

         --ss - Simulation mode.  No hardware commands are issued.  If started in
              simulation mode, simulation mode cannot be turned off without
              restarting the program.

         --yy - Yes, change motor controller registers initially if they disagree
              with the sseettttiinnggss file.  Normally, ssppeecc requires you to confirm
              such a change.  This flag would be useful if you know controller
              power had been turned off.

         --LL - Do not check or create the state-file lock.  Normally, ssppeecc
              prevents more than one instance of itself using the same user-name
              plus terminal-name derived state file.  In some situations,
              particularly if a site configures the state files to reside on an
              NFS-mounted disk, the lock test that spec uses always indicates
              another instance of ssppeecc is running, making it impossible to
              start.  This flag overrides that test.  Normally, this flag will
              not be used.

         --dd ddeebbuugg - Set the initial value of the debugging variable DDEEBBUUGG to
              ddeebbuugg.  See the _d_e_b_u_g help file for a list of the debugging
              categories.  A value of 192 is useful for debugging hardware
              problems.

         --gg ggeeoommeettrryy - Force loading of macro files and activation of geometry
              calculations for the specified geometry, while using the
              configuration files taken from the name by which ssppeecc is invoked.

         --NN mmyy__nnaammee - Use mmyy__nnaammee for setting the ssppeecc prompt and the name of
              the configuration file directory.  Also sets the geometry as if --gg
              was given as an argument.  To select a geometry not corresponding
              to mmyy__nnaammee, use the --gg flag after the --NN flag.

         --uu uusseerr - Use uusseerr's last saved state as the current user's initial
              state.

         --tt ttttyy - Use the current user (or uusseerr's) last saved state from the
              terminal specified by ttttyy.  The terminal can be specified as --tt
              //ddeevv//ttttyy0011 or --tt ttttyy0011. Note, ssppeecc uses the string ttttyypp## to refer
              to a pseudoterminal.

         --TT ffaakkee__ttttyy - This option creates a user state associated with
              ffaakkee__ttttyy, which may be any name (although only the first six
              characters are used).  This option allows you to bypass the
              locking feature that prevents multiple instances of ssppeecc to be
              started by the same user from the same terminal.

         --oo ooppttiioonn==vvaalluuee - Initializes the ssppeecc__ppaarr(()) ooppttiioonn to vvaalluuee.  See the
              _s_p_e_c___p_a_r help file for a list of the available options.  Multiple
              --oo options may be given.

         --CC ffiillee - Open the command file ffiillee as a start-up command file to be
              read after the standard start-up command files, but before the
              optional file ssppeecc..mmaacc in the current directory, which will always
              be read last.  If there is an error in reading or executing the
              commands in these files, ssppeecc will jump to the main prompt and not
              read any remaining queued command files.  Up to 32 files may be
              specified with multiple --CC options.  (This flag added in ssppeecc
              release 5.07.01-1.)

         --DD ddiirreeccttoorryy - Use ddiirreeccttoorryy instead of the compiled-in name (usually
              //uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//ssppeecc..dd) or the value of the SSPPEECCDD environmental
              variable (if set) as the auxiliary file directory.

         --pp ffdd ppiidd - Indicates that ssppeecc input is coming from a pipe from
              another program.  The argument ffdd is the file descriptor that ssppeecc
              should use for standard input.  The argument ppiidd is the process ID
              of the spawning process.  If ffdd is zero, ssppeecc will not re-echo
              input from the file descriptor to ssppeecc's standard output.

         --SS - Starts ssppeecc in server mode listening at the first available port
              in the default range of 6510 to 6530.

         --SS pp11 - Starts ssppeecc in server mode listening at the specified port
              number pp11.

         --SS pp11--pp22 - Starts ssppeecc in server mode listening on the first available
              port in the given range.

         --ll oouuttppuuttffiillee - Specifies an output file.  Output to the file will
              begin immediately, so will include the initial hardware
              configuration messages.  Files will be opened even when starting
              fresh.  (Added in ssppeecc release 5.09.02-2.)

ENVIRONMENT

     ssppeecc uses the following environment variables:
