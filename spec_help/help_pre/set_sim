set_sim                             function                             set_sim

NAME
     set_sim - set simulate (no hardware) mode

DESCRIPTION

     Simulate mode allows a user to exercise the program without accessing any
     of the hardware interfaces (for the most part, see below) or updating the
     motor-settings file.

     The function sseett__ssiimm(()) is used to turn simulate mode on and off.

     sseett__ssiimm((00)) - Turns simulate mode off.  Returns previous state.

     sseett__ssiimm((aarrgg)) - Turns simulate mode on if aarrgg is greater than zero.  If bit
          4 (0x10) is set in aarrgg, the user-level sslleeeepp(()) function is simulated,
          that is, ssppeecc does not sleep (as of ssppeecc release 6.00.06).  Returns
          previous state.

     sseett__ssiimm((--11)) - Doesn't change mode, but returns current state.  Bit
          assignments in the return value are as follows:

              Bit 0   0x01   Simulate mode by sseett__ssiimm(()) command
              Bit 1   0x02   Simulate mode on start up (--ss flag)
              Bit 2   0x04   No write access to sseettttiinnggss file
              Bit 3   0x08   Hardware locked by another user
              Bit 4   0x10   User-level sleep simulated

     Both sseett__ssiimm((00)) and sseett__ssiimm((aarrgg)), where aarrgg is greater than zero, wait for
     moving and counting to finish before changing the mode.  Also sseett__ssiimm((00))
     always rereads the motor settings file to restore the motor positions.

     Access to the user-level socket interface is disabled when in simulate
     mode, but can be left on by using the command ssoocckk__ppaarr((""iiggnnoorree__ssiimm"",, 11)).
     See the _s_o_c_k_e_t_s help file for details.

     Simulate mode is turned on when ssppeecc is invoked with the --ss flag and can't
     be turned off without restarting ssppeecc.  Also, if there is no write access
     to the ssppeecc sseettttiinnggss file or if the hardware is locked because another user
     is running an instance of ssppeecc using the same hardware configuration file,
     simulate mode is also turned on and cannot be turned off without restarting
     ssppeecc.

     Users normally use the macros oonnssiimm and ooffffssiimm to turn simulate mode on and
     off.  The macros document the changes in the data file.

     The ccoonnffiigg macro automatically invokes eeddccoonnff with the --ss flag when
     simulate mode is on.  This means the configuration file can't be changed
     using ccoonnffiigg when in simulate mode.
