NAME
     changes - highlights of modifications for ssppeecc release 4

RELEASE 4 - text in preparation

     These notes describe the general features added to ssppeecc for release 4.

Introduction
     ssppeecc release 4 has been in the works for many months.  It includes many new
     features to make the program easier to use and to support new hardware
     devices.  One of the main reasons for the new release is to accommodate
     two-dimensional detectors.  To that end, a new array data type has been
     added, along with functions and operators to work on the arrays.

     Preliminary support for a number of CCD cameras is already available,
     including models from Princeton Instruments and Photometrics.

     Descriptions of the new features in release 4 follow.

New Macro Functions
     Macro function are now available.  Macros can now be defined to return
     values and can be used as operands in expressions.  The macro definition
     can include function arguments, which then become available to the body of
     the macro function.  For example,

        ddeeff ffaaccttoorriiaall((nn)) ''{{
                iiff ((nn <<== 11))
                        rreettuurrnn((11));;
                rreettuurrnn((nn ** ffaaccttoorriiaall((nn--11))))
        }}''

New Array Data Type
     A new type of data array has been created.  Besides eventually replacing
     the never-popular data groups in the standard macros, the new arrays add
     new capabilities to ssppeecc.  Unlike ssppeecc's traditional aassssoocciiaattiivvee arrays,
     which can be indexed by arbitrary numbers or strings and which store
     elements in no particular order and not particularly efficiently, the new
     array data types are indexed by consecutive integers starting from zero and
     store data in contiguous memory, allowing efficient access.  The new arrays
     must be declared and dimensioned with the new aarrrraayy keyword to allow ssppeecc
     to allocate memory for the array and to distinguish the new arrays from the
     associative arrays.  See the _a_r_r_a_y_s help file for detailed information.

New CCD Camera Support
     Support for image acquisition using CCD cameras is now part of ssppeecc.
     Currently hardware support is available for a Photometrics model on an HP
     700 platform, several Princeton Instruments models on Sun platforms using
     an S-Bus SDV interface card and for the ESRF Frelon camera over several
     interfaces.  Support for additional cameras will be added as user needs are
     made known to CSS.

     The iimmaaggee__ggeett(()), iimmaaggee__ppuutt(()) and iimmaaggee__ppaarr(()) functions are available for
     reading the image and controlling the hardware.  Also, the new functions
     ffmmtt__wwrriittee(()) and ffmmtt__rreeaadd(()) allow the array data from the CCD cameras to be
     written to and read from binary data files.

New Password Protection For Designated Motors
     A new option to the ssppeecc__ppaarr(()) function allows ssppeecc administrators to gain
     access to motors locked out in the ccoonnffiigg file to ordinary users.  This
     features allows the administrator to position the motors without having
     first to go into the configuration editor to change access modes.  Entering
     ssppeecc__ppaarr((""ssppeeccwwiizz"",, 11)) causes ssppeecc to prompt for the ""WWiizzaarrdd''ss ppaasssswwoorrdd"".
     If entered correctly, the characters __WWIIZZ are appended to the prompt to
     remind the user of the special powers, and motors configured with protected
     status can be moved.  Entering ssppeecc__ppaarr((""ssppeeccwwiizz"",, 00)) disables the special
     mode.  The encrypted specwiz password is taken from the //eettcc//ppaasssswwdd file,
     just as with the specwiz feature for the configuration editor.

New ssrraanndd(()) Function
     The new function ssrraanndd((vvaalluuee)) sets the seed value for the random number
     generator used by the rraanndd(()) function to the integer vvaalluuee.  This feature
     allows the same sequence of random numbers to be generated reproducibly by
     resetting the seed to the same value.

wwhhaattiiss(()) Function Enhanced
     The wwhhaattiiss(()) function now produces a text description of the object
     specified by its first argument, if a second nonzero argument is supplied.
     The wwhhaattss macro takes advantage of the new syntax.

New MCA Features
         mca_par("disable")
         mca_get(array)
         mca_put(array)
         mca_spar(), mca_sput(), mca_sget()
         numbering is fixed in config file with @
         numbering needn't be consecutive
         mca_sel("?")
         ROI support

     PCA-II, PCA-3, PCA Multiport implements array get/put

Can Dynamically Assign Monitor Channel
     For certain counters, the scaler channel used for the monitor preset can be
     changed using the command ccoouunntteerr__ppaarr((mmnnee,, ""mmoonniittoorr"")).  Counters that
     currently support this feature are the KS 3640 CAMAC counter, the Joerger
     VSC16/8 VME scaler and the generic EPICS scaler.

Unlimited String Length For pprriinnttff(()) Family
     There is no longer a limit to the lengths of strings that can be printed or
     formatted using the pprriinntt, pprriinnttff(()), sspprriinnttff(()) and ffpprriinnttff(()) functions.

sseerr__ggeett(()), sseerr__ppuutt(()) Revised
     The sseerr__ggeett(()) function has been revised, rationalized ser_par(sel,
     "timeout")

Macro Facility Internals Rewritten
     The internal code for handling macros has been entirely rewritten.  Also,
     the internal copies of the macros are now saved in the same file with the
     other state information.  There are no more uusseerrffiilleess//uusseerr__ttttyy##MM in the
     auxiliary file directory

New Version of GNU Readline Library Bundled
     A newer version of the GNU readline library is now bundled with ssppeecc.

Obsolete Functions and Commands Are Gone
     The long-obsolete ffiixxssttaattee and ggeettssttaattee commands are gone (although the
     once-related ssaavvssttaattee command still exists).  The obsolete functions
     ppll__xxggeett(()), ppll__yyggeett(()), ppll__ppuutt(()), ppll__aannaall(()), ppll__dduummpp(()) and pplloott__ppttss(()) have
     been eliminated from the program, although, for the sake of way-backwards
     compatibility, the file mmaaccrrooss//ccoommppaatt..mmaacc contains replacement definitions
     for the functions.
