files                               reference                              files

NAME
     files - conventions for file/device output

BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS

     With this group of functions, the name ""ttttyy"", when used for ffiillee__nnaammee, is
     special and refers to the user's terminal.

     ooppeenn(()) - Lists all open files.  Returns zero.

     ooppeenn((ffiillee__nnaammee)) - Makes ffiillee__nnaammee, which is a string constant or
          expression, available for output.  Files are opened to append.
          Returns zero for success, -1 if the file can not be opened or if there
          are too many open files.

     cclloossee((ffiillee__nnaammee)) - Closes ffiillee__nnaammee and removes it from the table of files
          available for output.  Returns zero for success, -1 if the file wasn't
          open.  Any open file should be closed before attempting to modify the
          file with other UNIX utilities.  Otherwise the file may be corrupted
          if two processes are writing to the file.

     oonn(()) - Lists all open files and indicates which ones are currently turned
          on for output.

     oonn((ffiillee__nnaammee)) - Turns on ffiillee__nnaammee for output.  All messages, except for
          some error and debugging messages, but including all pprriinntt and
          pprriinnttff(()) output, are sent to all turned-on devices.  If ffiillee__nnaammee has
          not been made available for output with the ooppeenn(()) function, it will
          be opened.  Returns zero for success, -1 if the file can't be opened
          or if there are too many open files.

     ooffff((ffiillee__nnaammee)) - Turns off output to ffiillee__nnaammee, but keeps it in the list of
          files available for output.  If this was the last turned-on file or
          device, ttttyy is turned back on automatically.  Returns zero for
          success, -1 if the file wasn't open.

     If the user changes ssppeecc's current directory, open files may be referenced
     either by the name with which the files were opened or by the correct path
     name relative to the current directory.

     Errors during parsing or execution of commands, or typing a ^^CC turns off
     all open files except log files.  (A log file is a file with a name
     beginning with the characters lloogg.)

     Files should be closed before attempting to edit them outside of ssppeecc.

GLOBALS

     DDAATTAAFFIILLEE - Global variable, holds name of data file.

MACROS

     oonndd - turns DDAATTAAFFIILLEE on.

     ooffffdd - turns DDAATTAAFFIILLEE off.

     oonntt - turns ""ttttyy"" on.

     oofffftt - turns ""ttttyy"" off.
