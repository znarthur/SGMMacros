NAME
     ssttaarrttuupp - procedure to initialize parameters

SYNOPSIS

     ssttaarrttuupp

DESCRIPTION

     The ssttaarrttuupp macro lets you change the default parameters that are used by
     many of the macros in the standard library.  The ssttaarrttuupp macro gathers
     together initialization macros such as nneewwffiillee, sseettssccaannss, sseettpplloott and
     ssttaarrttggeeoo into one place. Also, ssttaarrttuupp prompts you for a title, the name of
     a command file directory, the default count time and the
     updated-move-and-count update interval.

     The title you enter will appear in the scan headers that are printed in the
     data file and on the screen.

     The command file directory name is used by the ddoo and qqddoo macros.  These
     macros look for command files in the command file directory if they are not
     in the current directory.  If you want to keep your ssppeecc command files in a
     special directory, you can enter that directory name.  Otherwise, you can
     enter a single dot to indicate the current directory.

     The default count time is initially one second and is used by the cctt and
     uucctt macros as the count time if no arguments are given.

     The update time controls how often the motor controllers or counters are
     read and the readings displayed on the screen during updated moving and
     counting.  The default value is 0.25 seconds.  Setting the value to zero is
     allowed, and causes the hardware registers to be read as often as possible.
     Entering zero or a small value may slow down other processes on the
     computer, though, so beware if you or someone else is trying to do
     something else from another window or terminal.
