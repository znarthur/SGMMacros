NAME
     changes - highlights of modifications for ssppeecc release 2.8

DESCRIPTION

     These notes summarize the modifications made for ssppeecc release 2.8, as
     finalized on August 6, 1988.

CHANGES

     The four-circle motors are now consistently referred to in the order tttthh tthh
     cchhii pphhii throughout ssppeecc.  (Previously, the order of cchhii and pphhii was
     reversed.)  The macros with changed usage are ppll, uuppll and ccii.  All the
     macros that produce output (wwhh, the scans, etc.)  use the new ordering
     convention.

     The global variable referring to the data file has been changed from
     FFIILLEENNAAMMEE to the more revealing DDAATTAAFFIILLEE.

     The order of arguments in the built-in functions ddiiaall(()), uusseerr(()), cchhgg__ddiiaall(())
     and cchhgg__ooffffsseett(()) has been changed to make the motor number the first
     argument in each case.  This change makes the argument ordering of these
     four functions consistent with the functions ggeett__lliimm(()) and sseett__lliimm(()).

     A new function named mmoottoorr__mmnnee((ii)) returns the mnemonic assigned to motor
     number ii in the ccoonnffiigg file.  The internal __cchheecckk00 macro, called by all
     standard macros that allow a motor number or mnemonic as an argument, now
     checks its argument against all valid mnemonics, rather than just that for
     motor 0, as it had previously.

     Most scans macros now include prescan motor-limit checks.

     Previously, certain of the ccaallcc(()) calls to the geometry code (ccaallccAA and
     ccaallccAABB, in particular) filled the AA[[]] array with the current motor
     positions.  That no longer happens.

     The four-circle geometry code has been made more robust (we like to think).
