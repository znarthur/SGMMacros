NAME
     changes - highlights of modifications for ssppeecc release 2.10

DESCRIPTION

     These notes summarize the modifications made for ssppeecc release 2.10, as
     finalized on October 21, 1988.

CHANGES

     Typing ssccaann__oonn continues a scan that was aborted.  Presently, mmeesshh scans
     cannot be restarted.  Also restarted delta scans (lluupp ddssccaann and dd22ssccaann)
     will not return the scanned motors to the center position after the
     restarted portion of the scan completes.

     Four-circle users may now assign cut points for angles set by the geometry
     calculation code.  The macro ccuuttss does the assignment.  Presently, cut
     points are used with tthh, pphhii, cchhii and oommeeggaa.  The user specifies the lesser
     cut point in degrees (integers only), and the angles will be set between
     that point and that point plus 360 degrees.  The aazziimmuutthh has a pseudo-cut
     point.  If its value is less than zero, the calculated azimuth will be
     between -180 and 0, otherwise the azimuth will be between 0 and +180.

     This release supports the old VENIX operating system on PDP 11/73
     computers.  See the ppddpp help file.
