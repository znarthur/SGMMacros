tw                                    macro                                   tw

NAME
     ttww - "tweak" motors

SYNOPSIS

     ttww  mmoottoorr [[mmoottoorr22 ......]] ddeellttaa [[ddeellttaa22 ......]] [[ccttiimmee]]

DESCRIPTION

     The ttww macro is used to interactively move one or more motors in small
     increments.  Each time you hit return the motor or motors specified in the
     arguments will be moved the amount given by the corresponding ddeellttaa
     parameters.  The delta parameters can be of different signs for the
     different motors.  You can change directions for all the motors by typing ++
     or -- (or pp or nn) before hitting return.  You can also enter a new (signed)
     delta for the first motor for subsequent moves.  The delta for the other
     motors will be changed proportionally.

     If the optional ccttiimmee parameter is given, the results of counting for the
     specified time will be displayed after each move.  If the settling-time
     parameter __sslleeeepp (set by the sseettssccaannss macro) is nonzero, counting will be
     delayed by the specified time.

     If the global variable TTWW__BBEEEEPP is nonzero, the macro will beep when the
     moving and counting is finished for each iteration.  By default, beeping is
     off.

     If the global variable TTWW__UUPPDDAATTEE is nonzero, the moving and counting values
     will be updated on the screen using the value of the standard UUPPDDAATTEE
     variable as the delay between each update.  By default, the updated mode is
     enabled.
