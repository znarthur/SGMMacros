NAME
     mmaabb - move to a given incident and reflected angle

SYNOPSIS

     mmaabb aallpphhaa bbeettaa

DESCRIPTION

     The mmaabb macro is used to set a surface diffractometer to a given angle of
     incidence aallpphhaa and to position the detector at a given angle of reflection
     bbeettaa (in the plane of incidence) with respect to the surface.  It does not
     necessarily move the detector into the plane of incidence.

EXAMPLE

     mmaabb 1100mmrr 1100mmrr
