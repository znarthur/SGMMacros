NAME
     changes - highlights of modifications for ssppeecc release 2.6

DESCRIPTION

     These notes summarize the modifications made for ssppeecc release 2.6, as
     finalized on June 6, 1988.

CHANGES

     The UUsseerr MMaannuuaall, RReeffeerreennccee MMaannuuaall and AAddmmiinniissttrraattoorr''ss GGuuiiddee are now
     relatively complete.  The UUsseerr MMaannuuaall contains an introductory tutorial
     chapter on basic diffractometer operation.

     The scan macros are substantially rewritten.  Refer to the RReeffeerreennccee MMaannuuaall
     for a discussion of their present form.

     The temperature control macros are substantially rewritten.  Refer to the
     RReeffeerreennccee MMaannuuaall.  In addition, thermistor conversions are now handled
     entirely within the macros.

     The plot-results output is now generated in a macro named pplloott__rreess, that
     can be invoked separately and can be easily modified by the user.

     The motor name uunnuusseedd is special.  Motors with that name won't appear on
     any of the standard-macro generated output.

     Bugs in the code for two CAMAC modules, the RTC018 clock and Joerger SMC
     motor controller, have been fixed.

     Bugs in the code for the four-circle ffrroozzeenn modes have been fixed.

     The geometry-specific standard macro file is now kept in ssppeecc..dd// rather
     than ssppeecc..dd//ccoonnff//.  The four-circle file is called
     //uussrr//lliibb//ssppeecc..dd//ffoouurr..mmaacc.

     The modulus operator (%%) now correctly converts its operands to integers
     before operating.

     New options for ppll__aannaall(()) return the minimum and maximum values of xx.

     The names ggppsseett, ssaavveeuussrr and ssaavveeggeeoo replace __ggppsseett, __ssaavveeuussrr and __ssaavveeggeeoo.
