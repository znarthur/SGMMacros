def                                  command                                 def

NAME
     ddeeff and rrddeeff - define a macro

SYNOPSIS

     ddeeff mmaaccnnaammee ssttrriinngg__ccoonnssttaanntt
     rrddeeff mmaaccnnaammee eexxpprreessssiioonn

DESCRIPTION

     The command ddeeff defines a macro named mmaaccnnaammee to be ssttrriinngg__ccoonnssttaanntt. Each
     time mmaaccnnaammee occurs on input, it will be replaced by ssttrriinngg__ccoonnssttaanntt.  The
     definition is made at the time the command is first read, so the macro can
     be used later in the same statement block in which it is defined and can be
     redefined within the same statement block.

     The command rrddeeff is similar to ddeeff, but the macro assignment is not made
     until the encompassing statements are parsed and executed.  Also, although
     eexxpprreessssiioonn is usually a string constant, it needn't be.
