NAME
     equipman - SPring-8 Equipment Manager RPC interface

DESCRIPTION

     Developers at SPring-8 (the 8-GeV Super Photon Ring in Hyogyo, Japan) are
     developing an remote procedure call (RPC) protocol for controlling motors,
     counters and other hardware.  ssppeecc includes initial support for the motors
     and counters and (as of release 4.05.10) a built-in function for sending
     arbitrary commands.

THE eemm__iioo(()) FUNCTION

     Arbitrary Equipment Manager commands can be sent using the eemm__iioo(([[hhoosstt,, ]]
     vvoocc)) function.  When invoked with two arguments, the first argument hhoosstt is
     a string containing the host name, such as ""bbll3355vvmmee00"", while the second
     argument is the vvoocc part of the command (verb-object-command?).  If called
     with just the vvoocc argument, the same host name as the previous eemm__iioo(()) call
     is used.  If the command  is a "get" vvoocc, the reply is returned as a
     string.  Otherwise the return value is a zero.  If there is an error, the
     return value is -1.

EQUIPMENT MANAGER MOTORS

     Configuration of the Equipment Manager (EM) motors is complicated by the
     length of the string needed to identify each motor.  In fact, two strings
     are needed to identify each motor.  One is the host name (associated with
     an IP address) for each VME crate.  The other string identifies the motor,
     for example as bbll__3355iinn__sstt11__mmoottoorr__11. ssppeecc assumes that for a particular
     crate, the first components of the motor strings will all be the same.
     This assumption lets the strings be specified within the current
     constraints of ssppeecc's configuration editor.

     To configure EM motors, on the DDeevviicceess screen, select the type of motor
     controller as "SPring-8 Equipment Manager (RPC)".  One controller entry is
     for an entire VME crate.  For the DDEEVVIICCEE, enter a string in the form
     hhoossttnnaammee::pprreeffiixx. The field width for this string is about 64 bytes, so very
     long strings can be accommodated.  An example for DDEEVVIICCEE would be
     bbll3355vvmmee00::bbll__3355iinn__sstt11. For the NNUUMM field, enter as many motors as will be
     used in the particular crate.  It is alright for the value to be bigger
     than necessary.

     By default, the unique part of the name will be mmoottoorr__nnuumm where nnuumm is
     motor number.  To configure an arbitrary string for the unique part of the
     name, use the optional motor-parameter screen of the configuration editor,
     accessed by typing mm (twice) from the main motor screen.  Enter the rest of
     the EM motor name (minus the intervening underscore __) as a string under
     "Generic Parameter 1". The field length there is only 18 bytes.  (That
     constraint is why the rest of the pprreeffiixx is entered with the crate host
     name.)  In the above example, the string would be mmoottoorr__11.

     Note, the division between what is prefix and what is the unique part for
     each motor is arbitrary, but must be consistent for each motor crate, with
     the unique part of the name fitting in the 18-character field on the second
     optional motor screen.

     With the Equipment Manager identification done, the ssppeecc motor names and
     mnemonics can be chosen as desired.

     Note, ssppeecc sets the software motor limits in the RPC server for each motor
     to agree with the software limits in the ssppeecc sseettttiinnggss file.  That is to
     say, the current software motor limits that could be obtained from the RPC
     server are ignored.

EQUIPMENT MANAGER COUNTERS

     To configure EM counters and counter/timers, first go to the DDeevviicceess screen
     of ssppeecc's hardware configuration editor.  In the scalers section, select
     the type of counter as either "SPring-8 EM Counters (RPC)" or "SPring-8 EM
     Counter/Timer (RPC)".

     For the DDEEVVIICCEE, enter a string in the form hhoossttnnaammee::pprreeffiixx. For the AADDDDRR,
     enter the module number of the counter in the crate.  The counter name will
     be formed by appending __ccoouunntteerr__AA or __ccoouunntteerr__AA__CC to the prefix (depending
     on whether the command is for the unit or an individual channel), where AA
     is the value of the AADDDDRR field and CC is the channel number of the counter
     from the scalers screen.
