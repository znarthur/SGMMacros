NAME
     wwhh - where, principal axes and reciprocal space

SYNOPSIS

     wwhh

DESCRIPTION

     The wwhh macro prints the current reciprocal space coordinates (HH KK LL) and
     the uusseerr positions of the principal motors.  Depending on the
     diffractometer geometry, other parameters such as the angles of incidence
     and reflection (AALLPPHHAA and  BBEETTAA) and the incident wavelength (LLAAMMBBDDAA) may
     be displayed.
