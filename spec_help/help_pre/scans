NAME
     ssccaannss..44 - read data from ASCII scan files

SYNOPSIS

     ffnn ssccaannss..44 [[ooppttiioonnss ssccaann__nnuummbbeerrss]]

DESCRIPTION

     The ssccaannss..44 function reads in files of ASCII data according to a modest set
     of conventions.

     When used with X-ray scattering data, ssccaannss..44 can perform scan averaging,
     background subtraction, data normalization and error-bar calculation.
     However, ssccaannss..44 works well with any kind of data file that follows the
     conventions described below.

     in 3D CC--PPLLOOTT mode.

     SPECIFYING SCANS

     Scans can be retrieved by entering either the scan number (option ++SS, the
     default) or the file position number (option --SS).  Scan numbers are
     determined by the ##SS lines in the file.  The file position number is the
     sequence position of the scan in the file, irrespective of scan number.

     When selecting by scan numbers, if there is more than one scan with the
     same number, the last of them is retrieved.  You can specify which instance
     of a repeated scan number to retrieve by appending a decimal point and an
     index number to the scan number.  For example, selecting scan number 1100..33
     retrieves the third scan from the start of the file that has scan number
     10.

     Negative numbers count back from the end of the file and are always
     considered to be file-position numbers.  For example,

        ffnn .. --11

     will always return the last scan in the file.

     You can enter multiple scan numbers to select the scans you are interested
     in.  Scan numbers that end with bb are used as background scans.  For
     example,

        ffnn .. 1122bb 1133 1144bb 1155bb 1166 1177bb

     Data in the background scans will be subtracted from the data in the
     non-background scans that has corresponding xx values.  Choosing a
     background scan will force the data to be sorted by xx values.

     You can read in a group of consecutive scans with

        ffnn .. 33--77 1100--1144

     This command would read in scans 3 through 7 and 10 through 14.

     FILE CONVENTIONS

     The scan files contain control lines, data lines and blank lines.  Control
     lines contain a ## character in the first column followed by a command word.
     Data lines generally contain a row of numbers.  Special data lines
     containing MCA data begin with an @@ character followed by a row of numbers.
     These data lines are ignored unless the use MCA data option ++MM is selected.

     The control conventions used by ssccaannss..44 are as follows:

     ##SS NN - starts a new scan.  Here, NN is the user's numbering scheme and is
          the number used when retrieving by scan number (++SS).  Most often the
          scan number is the position of the scan in the file.

     ##MM NN - indicates data was taken counting to nnuummbbeerr monitor counts.

     ##TT NN - indicates data was taken counting for NN seconds.

     ##NN NN [[MM]] - indicates there are NN columns of data.  If MM is present, it
          indicates there are MM sets of data columns on each line.  When
          collecting data from a multi-channel analyzer, for example, the data
          might be arranged with 16 points per line in the file to make the file
          easier to scan by eye.  In such a case, the control line would be ##NN 11
          1166.

     ##II NN - is for an optional multiplicative intensity-normalization factor.

     ##@@MMCCAA - indicates the scan contains MCA data.  If the ++MM option is
          selected, xx (2D or 3D) or yy (3D only) values will be calculated
          automatically.  In three-column mode, whether it is xx or yy depends on
          whether the xx==MM or yy==MM command line option is selected or on which
          interactive response was given.  Data in the lines starting with @@AA
          will be stuffed into the yy (2D) or zz (3D) data array.

     ##@@CCAALLIIBB aa bb cc - gives calibration factors for MCA data.  The xx (2D or 3D)
          or yy (3D only) values will be calculated using the formula

              x[i] = a + b * i + c * i * i

          where ii is the point number, starting from zero.  Calibration factors
          can be changed within the data portion of a scan for subsequent MCA
          data by the line

              @@CCAALLIIBB aa bb cc

          Before each scan is read by ssccaannss..44, the calibration parameters are
          initialized to zero.

     The following control lines are not commands but are printed out as they
     are encountered while reading a scan:

     ##CC - is a comment line.

     ##DD - is followed by the date and time the scan was taken.

     ##LL llaabbeell11  llaabbeell22 - is the data-column labels, with each label separated
          from the next by ttwwoo spaces.

     For example, a very simple file might have:

        ##SS 11
        ##NN 33
        ##LL TTeemmppeerraattuurree  VVoollttaaggee  CCoouunnttss
        2233..44 11..0011 3300445566
        2233..66 11..001155 2244000000

        ##SS 22
        eettcc..

     DATA COLUMNS

     When running CC--PPLLOOTT in 2D mode, the default behavior is to take xx values
     from the first column and yy values from the last column.  If in 3D mode, xx
     values are taken from the first column, yy values from the second and zz
     values from the last column.  If normalizing the data, the default behavior
     is to use the ##TT or ##MM values.  If neither appear, you must enter a column
     number for the normalization values.

     When entering column numbers, a negative number counts backward from the
     last column.  If the column for xx is zero, the value put in for xx is just
     the index number of the point.

     ENTERING OPTIONS

     If you give a dot ..  as the command-line argument or in response to
     ""SSccaannss//ooppttiioonnss"", the same argument or option string will be used as last
     time.  That is, the string is remembered, not the options chosen
     interactively using ""CChhaannggee mmooddeess??"".  For instance, if you enter a long
     sequence of scan numbers and read in the scans, then change something via
     ""CChhaannggee mmooddeess??"", you can simply enter a dot in response to ""SSccaannss//ooppttiioonnss""
     and recover the previous sequence of scan numbers.

     When you do enter a string of flags and scan numbers, the modes set by the
     flags only apply to the scans that follow the flags, not the preceding
     scans.

     THE INDEX FILE

     Reading a long ASCII data file takes time.  When ssccaannss..44 first opens a
     file, it scans the whole file and saves a directory of the scans in a
     binary-format index file.  The name of the index file is formed by
     appending ..II to the original data-file name.

     As long as the index file is more recent than the data file, ssccaannss..44 will
     use the information in the index file.

     NORMALIZATION AND ERROR BARS

     Data can be normalized to either monitor counts or time.  When normalizing
     to monitor counts, the error bars will include the uncertainty in the
     counting statistics of the monitor counts.  Otherwise there is no
     difference between specifying time or monitor counts.

     By default, ssccaannss..44 normalizes data to monitor counts, with the second to
     last data column used for the monitor count values.  Use the --nn flag to
     turn off normalization.  If a column number is selected using the mm==_c_o_l or
     tt==_c_o_l arguments, normalization is set to monitor or time mode,
     respectively, using the column number specified.  If the column number in
     either case is given as zero, the normalization mode and value given by the
     ##MM or ##TT directives for a particular scan in the data file are used.  It is
     an error for normalization mode to be on, for the normalization column to
     be set to zero and for no normalization directives to be present for a
     scan.

     The normalization modes selected remain in effect for subsequent scans.

     The values returned as error bars are those due to counting statistics (the
     square root of the number of counts).  When the counts are derived from the
     algebraic combination of detector, background and monitor counts, the error
     bars are calculated using the appropriate "propagation of errors"
     formalism.  See the source code for details.

     If the ++II option is selected, the counts for each point are multiplied by
     the value given by the ##II control line in the scan header.  If the ++II
     option is selected and the scan header doesn't contain a ##II control line,
     the counts are not changed.

     NUMBER OF POINTS AND SCANS

     Earlier version of ssccaannss..44..cc had built-in limits to the number of scans or
     raw data points that could be handled.  Those limits no longer exist.
