NAME
     counting - timer/scaler/mca commands and variables

BUILT-IN COMMANDS AND FUNCTIONS

     mmccoouunntt((tt)) - Begins counting for tt monitor counts. Returns ttrruuee.

     ttccoouunntt((tt)) - Begins counting for tt seconds. Returns ttrruuee.

     ccnntt__mmnnee((ii)) - Returns the string mnemonic of counter ii as given in the
          configuration file.

     ccnntt__nnaammee((ii)) - Returns the string name of counter ii as given in the
          configuration file.

     ccnntt__nnuumm((mmnnee)) - Returns the counter number corresponding to the counter
          mnemonic mmnnee, or -1 if there is no such counter configured.

     ccoouunntteerr__ppaarr((ii,, ss [[,, vv]])) - Returns or sets configuration parameters for
          counter ii.  Recognized values for the string ss include:

          ""mmoonniittoorr"" - Reassigns the scaler channel used as the monitor-preset
               counter to the channel associated with counter mmnnee.  Rereading
               the hardware configuration file with the ccoonnffiigg macro or rreeccoonnffiigg
               command will restore the monitor channel to that set in the
               ccoonnffiigg file.  This feature is only available with certain
               counters.  Counters that currently support this feature include
               the KS 3640 CAMAC counter, the Joerger VSC16/8 VME scaler and the
               generic EPICS scaler.
          ""ttiimmeerr"" - Reassigns the scaler channel used as the time-preset counter
               to the channel associated with counter mmnnee.  Rereading the
               hardware configuration file with the ccoonnffiigg macro or rreeccoonnffiigg
               command will restore the time channel to that set in the ccoonnffiigg
               file.  Currently no timers support this feature.
          ""ccoonnttrroolllleerr"" - returns a string containing the controller name of the
               specified counter.  The controller names are those used in ssppeecc's
               ccoonnffiigg files.
          ""uunniitt"" - returns the unit number of the specified counter.  Each
               counter controller unit may contain more than one counter
               channel.
          ""cchhaannnneell"" - returns the channel number of the specified counter.
          ""rreessppoonnssiivvee"" - returns a nonzero value if the counter responded to an
               initial presence test or appears otherwise to be working.
          ""ddiissaabbllee"" - returns a nonzero value if the counter has been disabled
               by software.  If vv is given and is nonzero, then the counter is
               disabled.  If vv is given and is zero, the counter becomes no
               longer disabled.  A disabled counter channel will not be accessed
               by any of ssppeecc's commands.  Any ccddeeff(())-defined macros will
               automatically exclude the portions of the macro keyed to the
               particular counter when the counter is software disabled.

     ggeettccoouunnttss - Loads the built-in array SS[[]] with the scaler counts.

VARIABLES

     SS[[]] - Built-in array that holds scaler contents after a ggeettccoouunnttss command.

     CCOOUUNNTT - Global variable that holds the default count time used by the cctt,
          uucctt and uuccttnn macros.

     CCOOUUNNTT__TTIIMMEE - Global variable that holds the actual count time used by the
          cctt, uucctt and uuccttnn macros.

     DDEETT - Global variable that is set to the channel to be used as the detector
          during scans, usually set to ddeett.

     MMOONN - Global variable that is set to channel to be treated as the monitor
          during scans, usually set to mmoonn.

     MMOONN__RRAATTEE - Global variable that holds the value SS[[MMOONN]]//SS[[sseecc]] and is
          updated in the count macro.

     Scaler channel assignments and scaler mnemonics are set in the ccoonnffiigg file.
     The standard assignments for the first three channels are:

         sseecc = channel 0
         mmoonn = channel 1
         ddeett = channel 2

MACROS

     ccoouunntteerrss [[nneeww__mmoonn nneeww__ddeett]] - With scaler channel arguments, this macro
          assigns those channels to the MMOONN and DDEETT symbols and displays the
          changed scaler assignment.  Without arguments, the macro displays the
          current counter assignments, then prompts for new counter channels for
          MMOONN and DDEETT.

     cctt - A macro that counts for CCOOUUNNTT time if invoked without arguments, or
          for the time given as an argument.  After counting, the macro prints
          the scaler contents.  If interrupted with a ^^CC, the counts at the time
          of the interrupt are displayed.

     uucctt - As above, but updates the screen with the scaler contents while
          counting.  The screen is updated every UUPPDDAATTEE seconds.  Only the first
          six counter channels are displayed.

     uuccttnn - As above, but uses cursor control commands to update a multiple line
          display at the bottom of the screen and will work with more than six
          counters.

     sshhooww__ccnnttss - A macro that reads counters and displays the scaler contents on
          the screen.

     ssccaann__ccoouunntt - Normally defined as __ccoouunntt, it is called by all the scan
          macros.  It is redefined in powder mode to be __ppccoouunntt.

     __ccoouunntt - Normally defined as ccoouunntt, redefined by the sseettssccaannss macro when
          updated counting during scans is in effect.

     ccoouunntt - Default routine for counting during scans.  It waits for moving to
          end, counts, waits and reads scalers.  It also uses the cchhkk__bbeeaamm
          macro.

     cchhkk__bbeeaamm - A hhooookk macro, normally defined as bbrreeaakk.  Can be used to wait
          for sufficient counts during scans.  See the macro source file
          ccoouunntt..mmaacc for details.

     uusseerr__ggeettccoouunnttss - A hhooookk macro that allows the user to insert code, if
          necessary, after the call to ggeettccoouunnttss either to postprocess the
          counter values, or to implement user-level counters.  For example, in
          a configuration where the distance between the detector and the sample
          varies with the cosine of an angle, uusseerr__ggeettccoouunnttss is defined to
          multiply SS[[DDEETT]] by an appropriate factor.

     uusseerr__pprreeccoouunntt - A hhooookk macro that allows the user to insert code to be run
          before the call to ttccoouunntt(()) or mmccoouunntt(()).

     uusseerr__ppoossttccoouunntt - A hhooookk macro that allows the user to insert code to be run
          after the call to ttccoouunntt(()) or mmccoouunntt(()).

     A negative argument to cctt, uucctt, uuccttnn or ccoouunntt means count to monitor
     counts.
