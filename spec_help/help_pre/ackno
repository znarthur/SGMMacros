DESCRIPTION

     The first version of ssppeecc was developed in early 1986 at Harvard University
     by Gerald Swislow (post doc) and Alan Braslau (grad student) in the
     laboratory of Peter Pershan to control a two-circle spectrometer and two
     variations on a liquid-surface spectrometer using PDP 11/34 and 11/73
     computers.

     Certified Scientific Software began development of the new ssppeecc in
     November, 1987.
