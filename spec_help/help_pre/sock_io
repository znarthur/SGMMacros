sockets                             function                             sockets

NAME
     sock_io (deprecated) - Connect to sockets

IMPORTANT NOTE

     The ssoocckk__iioo(()) functions are deprecated as of ssppeecc release 5.01.01.  Please
     see the _s_o_c_k_e_t_s help file for a description of the ssoocckk__ggeett(()), ssoocckk__ppuutt(())
     and ssoocckk__ppaarr(()) replacement functions.

BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS

     ssoocckk__iioo((hhoosstt::ppoorrtt,, ccmmdd [[,, aarrgg]) - Connects and communicates with sockets
          created by other processes on the local or a remote host.  The hhoosstt
          can be specified by a symbolic name or by an IP address.  The string
          ccmmdd is one of the following:

          ""??""  - Lists the command options available.
          ""sshhooww"" - Lists the current open sockets and their status.
          ""iinnffoo"" - Returns a string that lists the current open sockets and
               their status.
          ""ccoonnnneecctt"" - Opens the socket to the specified host and port.  Returns
               ttrruuee for success and ffaallssee for failure.
          ""lliisstteenn"" - Sets up a socket for listening, allowing another instance
               of ssppeecc or some other program to make a connection.
          ""cclloossee"" - Closes the socket associated with the specified host and
               port.
          ""sseenndd"" - Sends the string aarrgg to the specified socket, opening it if
               not already connected.
          ""rreeaadd"" - Reads from the specified socket, opening it if not already
               connected.  Currently, the message to be read can be no longer
               than 1,024 bytes.  With no argument, reads until a newline or
               until the timeout expires.  An optional string argument can
               specify an end-of-string (EOS) delimiter, in which case the
               socket will be read until characters matching the EOS sequence
               are read or until the timeout expires.  Trailing newlines and
               carriage returns will be removed from the returned string.  Also,
               if the optional argument is a number, it specifies the number of
               bytes to be read.  That number of bytes (or less, if the timeout
               expires) will be read and returned.
          ""ttiimmeeoouutt"" - With no argument, returns the current read-timeout value
               in seconds.  Otherwise, sets the read timeout to aarrgg.  A negative
               timeout value causes the socket read to block until it is
               satisfied.  The default timeout value is 5 seconds.

     Note, the ""ccoonnnneecctt"" command isn't required, as the connection will be made
     if needed with the other commands.  However, the return value from the
     ""ccoonnnneecctt"" command may be used to test if a socket can be created.  The
     connection remains open until the ""cclloossee"" option is used.  Simultaneous
     connections to multiple ports are allowed.

     The following example connects to the eecchhoo service on port 7 of the local
     host.
