NAME
     monochromator - monochromator control macros

DESCRIPTION

     ssppeecc supports energy-selecting monochromators in three configurations.  The
     first configuration uses a single motor to control the monochromator tilt.
     The second configuration uses three motors to control the tilt of two
     crystals and the travel distance between them.  The third configuration
     takes into account a fourth motor to control the offset between the two
     crystals.  (In the three-motor configuration the offset is a fixed
     parameter.)

     All of the monochromator support is contained in the macro source file
     mmaaccrrooss//eenneerrggyy..mmaacc, which is automatically installed with the standard macro
     library.  When the macros are read, commands from the eenneerrggyy..mmaacc file check
     whether particular motor mnemonics are present in the ccoonnffiigg file.  Motors
     with mnemonics mmoonnuu, mmoonndd, mmoonnttrraavv and mmoonnooffff select the four-motor
     configuration.  The mnemonics stand for the upstream, downstream, travel
     and offset monochromator motors.  If there are only motors with mnemonics
     mmoonnuu, mmoonndd and mmoonnttrraavv, the three-motor configuration is selected.  Having
     just a motor with a mnemonic of either mmoonnuu or mmoonnoo selects the one-motor
     configuration.

USER-INVOKED MACROS

     sseettmmoonnoo [[dd--ssppaacciinngg]] [[ooffffsseett]] - Used to enter the monochromator d-spacing.
          If using a three-motor monochromator, you can also enter the offset
          between the two crystals.  With no arguments, the macro will prompt
          you to enter values.  If you enter a 00 for the d-spacing in
          interactive mode, you will then be prompted to enter the type of
          crystal and its Miller indices.  The macro will then calculate the
          d-spacing for you.  The macro knows about Silicon and Germanium
          crystals.  For other materials, you need to enter the crystal lattice
          parameter.  The distributed sseettmmoonnoo only allows you to change the
          parameters if you have write permission for the file gg__mmoo__dd..mmaacc in
          ssppeecc's auxiliary file directory.  The current values of the parameters
          gg__mmoo__dd and gg__mmoo__ss (if used) are stored in that file.  If you can't
          write the gg__mmoo__dd..mmaacc file, the file is read as a command file.  If you
          can write to the file, the file will be updated with the new
          parameters.

     ggeettEE - Displays the current energy calculated from the monochromator motor
          position(s).

     mmoovveeEE eenneerrggyy__iinn__KKeeVV - Moves the monochromator motor(s) to correspond to the
          energy value given as an argument.  The macro writes the new energy to
          the data file using the ccoommmmeenntt macro.

     sseettEE eenneerrggyy__iinn__KKeeVV - Changes the user offset of the monochromator motor(s)
          so that the current motor position(s) correspond to the energy value
          given as an argument.  No motors are moved.  The sseett macro, which
          comments a change of a motor's user offset to the data file, is used
          within sseettEE.  (Additional motors that may be involved by way of the
          ccaallccMM__llooccaall macro will not be set by this macro.)

     EEssccaann ssttaarrtt eenndd iinntteerrvvaallss ttiimmee [[ ffiixxQQ ]] - Does an energy scan, starting at
          the energy given by ssttaarrtt and ends at the energy given by eenndd. The
          step size is ((ssttaarrtt--eenndd))//iinntteerrvvaallss.  The number of data points
          collected will be iinntteerrvvaallss++11.  Count time is given by ttiimmee, which if
          positive, specifies seconds and if negative, specifies monitor counts.
          If the optional fifth argument is given as the literal characters
          ffiixxQQ, the values of HH, KK and LL at the start of the scan are maintained
          at each point.

INTERNAL MACROS AND GLOBAL VARIABLES

     __aassssiiggnn__mmoonnoo - Figures out which kind of monochromator is being used from
          motor mnemonics specified in the ccoonnffiigg file.  This macro is called
          after the rreeccoonnffiigg statement in the ccoonnffiigg macro.

NOTES

     To control access to the monochromator parameters, the ssppeecc administrator
     can set the write permission and ownership of the gg__mmoo__dd..mmaacc file
     appropriately.

     To have the monochromator parameters automatically read in by each user
     running ssppeecc, put the line

         qqddooffiillee((sspprriinnttff((""%%ss//gg__mmoo__dd..mmaacc"",,SSPPEECCDD))))

     in the ssiittee..mmaacc file in the auxiliary file directory.  (The ssiittee..mmaacc file
     is automatically read as a command file each time a user starts ssppeecc.)

     The business of storing the monochromator parameters in a file will need to
     be changed if there is more than one version of ssppeecc using monochromators
     running at the same time on the same computer.
