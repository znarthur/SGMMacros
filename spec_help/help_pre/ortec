NAME
     ortec - Ortec 974/994/995/996/997 Counters and Timers

DESCRIPTION

     ssppeecc supports the Ortec 974, 994, 995, 996 and 997 counter and
     counter-timer NIM modules over both GPIB and RS-232C interfaces.  When
     running the configuration editor, select from the following descriptions on
     the device configuration screen to specify which Ortec modules you are
     using and how you are using them:

         Ortec 974/994 Counter/Timer (GPIB)
         Ortec 974/994 Counter/Timer (Serial)
         Ortec 974/994/995/996/997 Counter (GPIB)
         Ortec 974/994/995/996/997 Counter (Serial)
         Ortec 994/996 Counter and Blind Timer (GPIB)
         Ortec 994/996 Counter and Blind Timer (Serial)

     Only one module can be selected as a counter/timer.  The 974 module can be
     assigned a maximum of four channels.  The 994 should be assigned two
     channels normally and three channels when used as a blind timer.  The 996
     should be assigned one channel normally and two channels when used as a
     blind timer.  The 995 has two channels and the 997 has one.

     On the scaler configuration screen, choose OORR99XXXX as the controller for all
     channels associated with an Ortec module.  The unit numbers selected for
     each channel correspond to the order the Ortec modules appear on the device
     configuration screen.  When using the 994 as a blind timer, you must select
     channel number 2 for the timebase.  When using the 996 as a blind timer,
     you must select channel number 1 for the timebase.

Using the 974

     The 974 is a four-channel counter/timer having a minimum 0.1 second time
     base.  You should connect the monitor counts through a tee to the EXT IN
     connector on the back of module and to the COUNTER INPUT 2 connector on the
     front of the module.  Use the COUNTER INPUT 3 and 4 connectors for one or
     two detector input channels.  Also, make sure that the internal dip switch
     S-1 has position 6 set to one-cycle (ON/closed).

Using the 994 As a Normal Timer

     The 994 is a two-channel counter/timer with a minimum 0.01 second time
     base.  In order to obtain accurate elapsed time readings, one counter
     channel is used to count time and the other is used to count monitor
     counts.  An additional counter, such as the 995 or 997 is normally used to
     accumulate detector counts and is gated by the 994.  The monitor count
     source should be connected to both the IN A and IN B front panel connectors
     of the 994 using a tee.  The internal jumpers W3 and W4 (located underneath
     the interface board) must both be set to the TIME position (the rightmost
     two pins on W3, the leftmost two pins on W4).  Jumper W1 must be set to the
     NORMAL position (the two rightmost pins).  Also, make sure the internal dip
     switch on the interface card has position 6 set to one-cycle (ON), position
     7 set to COUNTER/TIMER (OFF) and position 8 set to NORMAL (ON).  Finally,
     make sure the front panel DWELL switch is turned all the way off.

Using the 994 or 996 as a Blind Timer

     In the blind timer mode, the 994 has the monitor counts connected to IN A
     and detector counts connected to IN B.  The 996 has only one input which
     would be used for detector counts.  The internal jumpers W3 and W4 (for the
     994) must be set to the COUNTS position (the leftmost two pins on W3, the
     rightmost two pins on W4).  Jumper W1 must be set to the NORMAL position
     (the two rightmost pins).  Also, make sure the internal dip switch S-1 has
     position 6 set to one-cycle (ON), position 7 set to COUNTER/TIMER (OFF) and
     position 8 set to NORMAL (ON).  Finally, make sure the front panel DWELL
     switch on the 994 is turned all the way off.

     When operated as a blind timer, ssppeecc cannot read back the elapsed time from
     the module.  Instead, the elapsed count time is estimated from the software
     clock when counting to monitor counts, when counting in powder mode, when
     reading the counters during updated counting and when counting is aborted
     with a ^^CC.

Polling and Alarm Mode

     Initially, spec used alarm mode to detect when counting was over, but an
     Ortec firmware update in the late 1990s changed the behavior of alarm mode.
     With the new firmware, ssppeecc sometimes missed the end of the counting
     interval.

     The alternative to alarm mode is to read the counter values until the
     elapsed time or the preset count has reached the programmed value.  For
     non-blind-timer configurations, ssppeecc stopped using alarm mode for
     GPIB-interfaced units with release 4.03.10 and for serial-interfaced units
     with release 5.09.1-11.

     For blind-timer configurations, alarm mode isn't necessary when counting to
     a monitor preset, but the ssppeecc Ortec support was not updated to eliminate
     alarm mode in that specific configuration until ssppeecc release 6.00.11-2.
     Alarm mode is still required when counting to time in blind-timer mode.
     However, when doing updated counting (where ssppeecc reads the counters
     periodically and where the problems with alarm mode occur most often), ssppeecc
     checks the software clock after reading the counters.  If the elapsed time
     is 0.5 seconds beyond the programmed count time, ssppeecc will stop the current
     count interval.

Gating

     An external enable signal from certain motor controllers may be be fed into
     the rear-panel gate BNC input on the 974 or the front panel enable BNC
     input on the 994 for precise counter gating in powder-mode scans.

     If using a second Ortec module as a counter, you must connect the INTERVAL
     BNC connector (rear panel on 974, front panel on 994) to the master GATE on
     the 974 rear panel or to the ENABLE or individual GATE inputs on the 994,
     995, 996 or 997 modules.

Setting Operational Parameters

     The ccoouunntteerr__ppaarr(()) function can be used to set various parameters associated
     with the Ortec module code in ssppeecc.  The first argument to ccoouunntteerr__ppaarr(()) is
     a channel number, although all the commands affect all channels of the
     associated module, or all of the Ortec modules, if appropriate.

     ccoouunntteerr__ppaarr((ccoouunntteerr,, ""aallaarrmm"",, mmooddee)) - If mmooddee is zero, turns off the alarm
          mode of operation of the timer, and turns on a polled mode.  If mmooddee
          is one, alarm mode is turned on.

          When alarm mode is enabled and the counter is using a GPIB interfaces,
          the counter sets a special bit in the GPIB serial poll byte at the end
          of counting.  On serial interfaces, the counter sends an asynchronous
          message containing the count results.

          The default operation used to be for alarm mode to be turned on.
          However, a late twentieth century firmware update from Ortec changed
          the behavior of alarm mode such that it was no longer robust with
          ssppeecc.  Thus, alarm mode is disabled by default except for blind-timer
          mode with the 994 and 996 when counting to a time preset.

     ccoouunntteerr__ppaarr((ccoouunntteerr,, ""aallaarrmm"")) - Returns one if alarm mode is on.  Otherwise
          returns zero.

     ccoouunntteerr__ppaarr((ccoouunntteerr,, ""ddiissppllaayy"",, cchhaannnneell)) - Sets the counter channel that
          will be displayed on the associated module.  For the 974 modules,
          valid values for cchhaannnneell are 1 to 4.  For the the 994 and 995 modules,
          valid values for cchhaannnneell are 0 and 1.

     ccoouunntteerr__ppaarr((ccoouunntteerr,, ""ddiissppllaayy"")) - Returns the channel number currently
          being displayed.

     ccoouunntteerr__ppaarr((ccoouunntteerr,, ""llooccaall"",, mmooddee)) - If mmooddee is nonzero, will force the
          associated module to go into local mode to allow front panel
          operation.  In addition, the module will be placed in local mode after
          each count interval.  If mmooddee is zero, the module will be set to
          remote mode at the start of the next count interval, and will not be
          set back to local mode after counting.  When ssppeecc starts up, not
          switching to local mode is the default behavior to minimize overhead.

     ccoouunntteerr__ppaarr((ccoouunntteerr,, ""llooccaall"")) - Returns zero if the associated module is to
          be kept in remote mode.  Otherwise, returns one.
