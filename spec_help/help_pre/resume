resume                                macro                               resume

NAME
     rreessuummee - continue an aborted scan

SYNOPSIS

     rreessuummee [[nn||--nn]]

DESCRIPTION

     The rreessuummee macro (also called ssccaann__oonn) resumes a scan that was previously
     aborted.  With a positive argument, nn points are skipped.  A negative
     argument redoes the previous nn points.

     For example, rreessuummee --11 redoes the previous point, while rreessuummee 33 skips the
     next three points.  Giving a very large number will force the end-of-scan
     plots, etc., without taking any more data points.
