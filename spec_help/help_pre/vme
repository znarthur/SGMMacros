SUPPORTED CONTROLLER CARDS

     ssppeecc supports the following VME controllers.  Note, SBS (formerly Bit 3) is
     now GE Fanuc.

         SSBBSS ((BBiitt 33)) MMooddeell 440033 IISSAA - Available on LLiinnuuxx and on HP-700 platforms
              with E/ISA slots.  Only A16 access supported.  No kernel drivers
              involved.

         SSBBSS ((BBiitt 33)) MMooddeell 661166//661177//661188//662200 PPCCII wwiitthh SSBBSS DDrriivveerr - Available on
              LLiinnuuxx with the SBS model 1003 v1.0 driver, on Solaris platforms
              with the SBS model 945 driver and on HP platforms with the SBS
              model 934 driver.  If the SBS controller is to be the master on
              the VME crate, be sure to set the system controller jumpers on the
              SBS VME module.

         SSBBSS ((BBiitt 33)) MMooddeell 661166//661177//661188 PPCCII wwiitthh nnoo DDrriivveerr - ssppeecc provides
              built-in user level support on LLiinnuuxx platforms, which may be
              useful on platforms with kernel versions not supported by the SBS
              driver.  This built-in support doesn't include support for DMA
              transfers, though.  If the SBS controller is to be the master on
              the VME crate, be sure to set the system controller jumpers on the
              SBS VME module.

         SSBBSS ((BBiitt 33)) MMooddeell 448877--11 EE//IISSAA - Requires SBS (Bit 3) Model 933 support
              software.  DMA transfers supported.  Note, you must use the HP
              eeiissaa__ccoonnffiigg utility to change the default board settings to
              include "Memory Mapping Enabled" and "Privilege Checks Disabled".

         SSBBSS ((BBiitt 33)) MMooddeell 446666--11 SSBBuuss - Requires SBS (Bit 3) Model 944 support
              software.

         SSBBSS ((BBiitt 33)) MMooddeell 446677--11 SSBBuuss - Same as Model 466-1 above, but DMA
              transfers supported.

         SSttrruucckk MMooddeell SSIISS11110000//33110000 PPCCII - Available on LLiinnuuxx using either ssppeecc's
              built-in driverless support or using Struck's kernel driver.  The
              built-in support doesn't include support for DMA transfers.

         SSttrruucckk MMooddeell SSIISS33115500 UUSSBB - Available on LLiinnuuxx and Mac OS X platforms
              using ssppeecc's built-in support.

BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS

     The type of data access and/or VME address modifier for the functions can
     be selected with the optional argument ooppttss as follows (if more than one
     option is needed, make a comma-separated list in the single string
     argument):

         ""DD88"" - byte access.

         ""DD1166"" - short-word access.

         ""DD3322"" - long-word access, but only available with vvmmee__ggeett3322(()) and
              vvmmee__ppuutt3322(()).

         ""AA1166"" - use A16 (amod=0x2D) addressing.

         ""AA2244"" - use A24 (amod=0x3D) addressing, on adapters that support it.

         ""AA3322"" - use A32 (amod=0x0D) addressing, on adapters that support it.

         ""DDPPRRTT"" - use dual-port memory access (amod=0x1D), on adapters that
              support it.

         ""aammoodd==00xxXXXX"" - specify the hexadecimal value for the address modifier.

     The vvmmee__mmoovvee(()) function recognizes the following additional strings in its
     fourth argument:

         ""nnoo__ddmmaa"" - Don't use the DMA interface for this transfer, even if it is
              available.

         ""nnoo__iinncc"" - Rather than increment the VME address for each item
              transferred, write each item to the same VME address.

     The default mode for the A16 access functions vvmmee__ggeett(()) and vvmmee__ppuutt(()) is
     D8.  The default mode for the A32 access functions vvmmee__ggeett3322(()) and
     vvmmee__ppuutt3322(()) is D32.  The defaults for all functions can be overridden by
     options in the ooppttss string.

     Not all VME adapters supported by ssppeecc support A32 access.

     vvmmee__ggeett((aaddddrr [[,, ooppttss]])) - Returns the data at aaddddrr in the 64K A16 address
          space.

     vvmmee__ppuutt((aaddddrr,, ddaattaa [[,, ooppttss]])) - Writes ddaattaa to aaddddrr in the 64K A16 address
          space.

     vvmmee__ggeett3322((aaddddrr [[,, ooppttss]])) - Returns the data at aaddddrr in the A32 address
          space.

     vvmmee__ppuutt3322((aaddddrr,, ddaattaa [[,, ooppttss]])) - Writes ddaattaa to aaddddrr in the A32 address
          space.

     vvmmee__mmoovvee((ffrroomm,, ttoo [[,, ccnntt [[,, ooppttss]]]])) - Copies data between a ssppeecc data array
          and VME address space.  One of the ffrroomm and ttoo arguments must be the
          name of a ssppeecc data array while the other must be a VME address.  If
          the optional argument ccnntt is present, it designates how many data
          items (not bytes) to copy.  If missing or zero, the number of elements
          in the array is copied.  A32 addressing is used by default.  The
          default data size is determined by the data size of the array.  Both
          can be overridden by ooppttss.

MULTIPLE VME CONTROLLERS

     ssppeecc allows up to four VME controllers to be configured by the same
     instance of ssppeecc.  In the configuration editor, use the ^^FF and ^^BB command
     on the VME controller line of the IInterfaces screen to configure each
     controller.  To include a unit number in a VME address for a device, enter
     the address using the notation uunniitt::aaddddrreessss. An absent uunniitt:: prefix implies
     VME controller unit zero.

     In the ccoonnffiigg file, the unit number associated with a VME controller is
     specified with @@vvmmee__00, @@vvmmee__11, etc.

     For the vvmmee__ggeett(()), vvmmee__ggeett3322(()), vvmmee__ppuutt(()), vvmmee__ppuutt3322(()) and vvmmee__mmoovvee(())
     functions, the VME unit numbers are encoded using the same ""uunniitt::aaddddrreessss""
     syntax as above. For the function calls, such an address argument must be
     passed as a string by using quotes to make a constant string, or by passing
     a string-valued variable.
