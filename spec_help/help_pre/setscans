setscans                              macro                             setscans

NAME
     sseettssccaannss - configure scan options

DESCRIPTION

     The sseettssccaannss macro asks the following questions:

     SSlleeeepp ((sseettttllee)) ttiimmee bbeeffoorree eeaacchh ssccaann ppooiinntt ((00))??

         Setting the sleep time to a nonzero value causes the scan macros to
         delay for that many seconds before counting at each point.

         The value entered here is assigned to the __sslleeeepp global variable, which
         can also be assigned to directly.

         The default value is zero.

          a feature where during moving and counting in scans, the motor
          positions or scaler contents are continually read and displayed on the
          screen.  This feature works by redefining the standard macros __ccoouunntt
          and __mmoovvee.

          The default value is no.

         The prescan limit checks calculate motor positions for each point of
         the reciprocal space scans before moving any motors.  On slower
         computers and for long scans these calculations can be annoyingly slow.
         You can disable these checks if you are reasonably sure your scans will
         not take motors outside their configured limits.  Disabling prescan
         limit checks doesn't disable limit checking during the actual moves.
         Rather, it simply avoids having a scan aborted because of an attempt to
         move to a reciprocal space position that takes motors beyond their
         limits.

         The value entered here is assigned to the __pprree__cchhkk global variable,
         which can also be assigned a zero or nonzero value directly.

         The default value is 1 (yes).

         Normally, ssppeecc doesn't write motor positions to the data file at each
         point in a scan when scanning over reciprocal space coordinates.  The
         reason is that the motor positions can be recovered, if necessary, from
         the HHKKLL coordinates that are saved, saving the motor positions can
         double the size of the data file, and as a rule, users use the
         reciprocal space coordinates rather than the motor positions in
         subsequent analysis of the data.  However, if this option is selected,
         the positions of the geometry-related motors will be saved at each
         point for all standard HHKKLL linear, arc, radial and mesh scans.  (This
         option was introduced to the standard macros in ssppeecc release
         5.05.01-7.)

         The value entered here is assigned to the __ssaavv__ggeeoo__mmoott global variable,
         which can also be assigned a zero or nonzero value directly.

         The default value is 0 (no).

GLOBALS

     UUPPDDAATTEE - The number of seconds between screen updates during updated moving
          and counting.

     __sslleeeepp - The settle time, in seconds.

     __pprree__cchhkk - If set, do the prescan limit checks for reciprocal-space scans.

     __ssaavv__ggeeoo__mmoott - If set, save geometry-related motor positions in the data
          file for reciprocal-space scans.
