NAME
     setpowder - configure powder-averaged scans

DESCRIPTION

     The sseettppoowwddeerr macro is used to turn the powder-average mode on or off.  Its
     usage is:

     sseettppoowwddeerr mmoottoorr ffuullll__wwiiddtthh - turns powder mode on, sets parameters.

     sseettppoowwddeerr ooffff - turns powder mode off.

     sseettppoowwddeerr uunnii - turns unidirectional scanning on.

     sseettppoowwddeerr --uunnii - turns bidirectional scanning on.

     sseettppoowwddeerr - turns powder mode on, asks for parameters.

     When powder mode is on, the powder motor will be rocked the full width
     specified at each point in a scan.  Counts will be accumulated while the
     motor is moving.  Powder mode works with all the angle scans and the HHKKLL
     scans.

     The syntax for invoking scans remains unchanged.  You must still give the
     count-time parameter, although its value is only used to select the order
     in which the time and monitor counts are recorded for each data point in
     the data file.  (In the future, the count-time parameter may be used to set
     the motor velocity.)

     By default, the motors are rocked at the base rate as configured in the
     ccoonnffiigg file.  To accommodate a faster rocking speed that requires
     accelerating from a base rate or a powder speed different from the base
     rate, the following mmoottoorr__ppaarr(()) motor parameters are available (as of ssppeecc
     release 5.05.05-1): ""ppoowwddeerr__bbaassee"", ""ppoowwddeerr__sslleeww"" and ""ppoowwddeerr__aacccceelleerraattiioonn"".
     The values for the first two parameters are set to the motor base rate and
     the last to the motor acceleration when ssppeecc starts up and on every
     rreeccoonnffiigg command (or ccoonnffiigg macro invocation).  If the ""ppoowwddeerr__sslleeww"" value
     is less than the ""ppoowwddeerr__bbaassee"" value both the base and slew rates are set
     to the ""ppoowwddeerr__sslleeww"" value.

     (Certain motor controllers, namely the 18011, CM3000, CM4000, E500, ES_OMS,
     ES_VPAP, HUB9000, IP28, MC4, MCB, SIX19, SMC and XRGCI_M, do not recognize
     the above parameters.  Contact CSS to discuss the feasibility of adding
     support for the parameters for any of these controllers.)

     By default, the powder mode moves the rocked motor in opposite directions
     at successive points to save time.  If unidirectional mode is selected, the
     motor is scanned in the same direction for each point with the direction
     determined by the sign of the ffuullll__wwiiddtthh parameter.  The motor movements do
     not include backlash corrections in either case.  At the end of the scan,
     or if the scan is aborted, the rocked motor will be returned to its
     position at the start of the scan, correcting for backlash, as of the
     powder-mode macros included in ssppeecc release 5.06.01-4.  Prior to that, the
     rocked motor would be left at its last position without a backlash
     correction.

     Powder mode works by redefining the macros ssccaann__mmoovvee and ssccaann__ccoouunntt that
     are called at each point in a scan.  The return to starting position of the
     rocked motor is accomplished using the cclleeaannuupp__oonnccee and ssppeecc__ssccaann__ttaaiill
     macros.
