history                              command                             history

NAME
     hhiissttoorryy - command recall facility (basic)

SYNOPSIS

     hhiissttoorryy [[nn||--nn]]

DESCRIPTION

     The hhiissttoorryy command lists the 1000 most recently entered commands.  With
     the option nn, only the nn most recent commands are listed.  A --nn lists the
     commands in reverse order.

     The history is saved when ssppeecc exits and restored when ssppeecc restarts with
     the same state files.

     The rest of this document describes the CSS-provided version of the history
     syntax.  If your site administrator has chosen to include the optional GNU
     rreeaaddlliinnee history code when ssppeecc was installed, refer to the rreeaaddlliinnee help
     file, instead.

     The history feature lets you recall previous commands.  The syntax is a
     subset of that of the ccsshh history command.  Examples of the recognized
     syntax are:

         !!!!   - redo the previous command.
         !!1144  - redo command number 14.
         !!--22  - redo the second to previous command.
         !!aasscc - redo the last command that began with aasscc.
         !!aasscc --1100000000  - As above and append --1100000000 to the command.

     The command number is prepended to the ssppeecc prompt as an aid in using the
     history feature.  Only commands typed at the keyboard are remembered for
     history, and no more than 1000 commands are retained.  The history feature
     cannot be used in command files.

     Command recall must occur at the beginning of a line.  Text may follow the
     command-recall word to extend that command.

     Appending ::ss//lleefftt//rriigghhtt// to a recalled command will modify the first
     occurrence of the string lleefftt in the recalled command to the characters
     rriigghhtt. The delimiter of the left and right strings may be any character.
     The final delimiter is optional.  If lleefftt is empty, the last entered left
     string is used as the pattern to match.

     In addition, ^^lleefftt^^rriigghhtt^^ at the start of a line is shorthand for
     !!--11::ss//lleefftt//rriigghhtt//.  In this case, the circumflex (^^) must be used as the
     delimiter.  The final delimiter is optional.
