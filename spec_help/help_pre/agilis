NAME
     Agilis - Newport Agilis AG-UC2 and AG-UC8 Piezo Controllers

DESCRIPTION

     The Newport Agilis AG-UC2 and AG-UC8 piezo controller modules are both
     supported by spec.  The Agilis AG-UC2 uses a USB interface while the AG-UC8
     can use either a serial or USB interface.

     The AG-UC2 controller handles two axes which can be operated
     simultaneously.  The AG-UC8 has four channels, each of which functions as a
     two-axis AG-UC2 for a total of eight axes.  However, only one of the
     two-axis channels in the AG-UC8 can be active at a time.  The settings and
     current positions for the channels are not maintained in the AG-UC8 when
     switching from one two-axis channel to the next.  ssppeecc's AG-UC8 support
     handles the multiplexing transparently, making it is possible to specify
     new positions for all eight actuators on the AG-UC8 in one command.  ssppeecc
     will take care of synchronizing parameters and moving the channels in
     sequence.

CONFIGURATION

     Select "Newport Agilis (Serial)" as the controller type for both the AG-UC2
     and the AG-UC8, even when using the USB connection.  The Agilis models use
     an FTDI USB interface chip that is recognized by drivers available on both
     LLiinnuuxx and Mac OS X.  The kernel driver makes the device appear as a serial
     interface to ssppeecc.

     On LLiinnuuxx, the standard ffttddii__ssiioo kernel module is required.  Recent LLiinnuuxx
     kernels include recognition of the Agilis USB device IDs in the ffttddii__ssiioo
     driver.  For older kernels, edit a file in //eettcc//mmoodduullee..dd// (a file could be
     created named llooccaall..ccoonnff, for example) to add the line:

        ooppttiioonnss ffttddii--ssiioo pprroodduucctt==00xx33000000 vveennddoorr==00xx110044dd

     On OSX, the VCP driver available at the _f_t_d_i_c_h_i_p_._c_o_m must be installed.
     The Newport Agilis USB vendor and product IDs need to be added to the
     kernel extension IInnffoo..pplliisstt file as explained in the _F_T_D_I _T_e_c_h_n_i_c_a_l _N_o_t_e
     _1_0_5 available at the FTDI website.  Contact CSS for assistance, if needed.

     If using a direct serial connection to the AG-UC8, select a baud rate of
     115200.  If connecting the AG-UC2 directly or using the USB port on the
     AG-UC8, the baud rate should be 921600.

     In some configurations, the serial communication between ssppeecc and the
     Agilis may need to be slowed.  Non-standard optional parameters named
     ""wwddeellaayy"" and ""rrddeellaayy"" can be set from the DDevices screen of the
     configuration editor.  These parameters set a delay time before write
     commands to the Agilis and before reading replies, respectively.  Units for
     the parameters are seconds.  A delay of 0.010 seconds has been needed in at
     least one installation.  ssppeecc limits the delay to a maximum of 0.5 seconds.
     Type pp from the DDevices screen to create and edit nonstandard optional
     controller parameters.  The delays can only be set in the ccoonnffiigg file.

     The step amplitude associated with the controller's SSUU command can be
     configured as a nonstandard optional parameter for each motor from the
     MMotor screen of ssppeecc's hardware configuration editor.  There are separate
     parameters for positive and negative movements, named ""aammpplliittuuddee++"" and
     ""aammpplliittuuddee--"".

     An additional nonstandard optional parameter named ""PPAA__ttaarrggeett"" can be
     configured to set the target position used with the hhoommee command, as
     explained in the next section.

     Type pp from the MMotor screen to create and edit nonstandard optional motor
     parameters.  All three parameters can also be changed and examined within
     ssppeecc using mmoottoorr__ppaarr(()), whether or not they are added to the ccoonnffiigg file.

HOMING

     There are two types of home search implemented in ssppeecc for the Agilis
     controllers.  The cchhgg__ddiiaall((mmnnee,, ""lliimm++"")) and cchhgg__ddiiaall((mmnnee,, ""lliimm--"")) commands
     will use the controller's MMVV command to send the actuator to the positive
     or negative limit switches.  Of course, the command will only work with
     stages that have limit switches.  The movement can be done at four possible
     speeds, which are set using the hhoommee__mmeetthhoodd optional motor parameter as
     follows:

         1   5 steps/sec at defined step amplitude
         2   100 steps/sec at maximum step amplitude
         3   1700 steps/sec at maximum step amplitude
         4   666 steps/sec at defined step amplitude

     If the hhoommee__mmeetthhoodd parameter is not set, method 4 will be used.

     The second home search uses the PPAA command and is initiated with the
     ""hhoommee"", ""hhoommee++"" and ""hhoommee--"" options to cchhgg__ddiiaall(()).  These are the options
     used with cchhgg__ddiiaall(()) within ssppeecc's standard hhoommee macro.  All three options
     produce the same action on the Agilis.

     With the PPAA command, the controller first moves the stage to the positive
     limit.  The stage is then moved to the negative limit while steps are
     counted.  The stage is moved back to the positive limit, then moved the
     number of steps needed to position the stage at a specified percentage of
     the total distance.  That percentage is taken from the parameter
     ""PPAA__ttaarrggeett"", which can have a value from 0 to 100, with a precision of one
     part in a thousand.  If unset, a value of 50 is used.

     Note, the PPAA procedure can take a couple of minutes to perform.  However,
     the search can be interrupted with ^^CC.
