NAME
     Mizar - Mizar MZ 8310 Counter/Timer Module

DESCRIPTION

     The Mizar MZ 8310 VME module uses two Advanced Micro Devices Am9513
     timer/counter chips.  These chips each contains five 16-bit counters.  ssppeecc
     chains four of these counters on each chip to make two 32-bit counters on
     each chip.  The remaining 16-bit counter on the first chip is used to keep
     track of real time.  With ssppeecc you can count to a fixed time or to a fixed
     number of monitor counts, under software control.

     The Mizar module is selected in the ssppeecc ccoonnffiigg file by a line similar to

         PPCC__MMIIAAZZRR == 00xxff880000 55 IIRRQQ44

     The first parameter is the 16-bit VME address.  Next is the number of
     counter channels, which includes the real-time counter.  Last is the VME
     interrupt vector, or the word PPOOLLLL if not using interrupts.  The ddeevviicceess
     (D) screen of the eeddccoonnff program (normally run from the ccoonnffiigg macro) is
     used to assign the parameters.  On the ssccaalleerr (S) screen, be sure to assign
     the timebase to channel 0 and the monitor to channel 1.

     The Mizar chip must be wired up in particular way for use with ssppeecc.  The
     wire-wrap pins on jumper blocks K1 and K2 can be used, or the pins on the
     front panel connector J1 can be used.  NOTE:  Mizar mislabels the pins for
     jumper blocks K1 and K2 on pages 3 and 4 of their manual.  The K2 jumper
     block should be labeled with the chip 1 pins (1O1, 1O2, etc.)  and the K1
     jumper block should be labeld with the chip 2 pins (2O1, 2O2, etc.).  The
     manual has these designations reversed.

     For ssppeecc, monitor counts must go to 1S5 (chip 1, source 5).  Detector 1 is
     connected to 1S3 (chip 1, source 3).  Detector 2 is connected to 2S3 (chip
     2, source 3), and detector 3 is connected to 2S5 (chip 2, source 5).

     In addition, you must connect the 1O1 (chip 1, output 1) signal to the
     following gates: 1G2, 1G4, 1G5, 2G2 and 2G4.

     If using interrupts, you must also connect 1O1 to IRQD.  IRQA, IRQB and
     IRQC should be left unconnected.  Use the K6 jumper block to connect IRQD
     to one of the VME interrupts (IRQ4 is the most convenient).  Make sure
     jumper block K4 is consistent with that choice.

     The ggeettccoouunnttss command will place elapsed time in SS[[00]], and the monitor
     counts in SS[[11]]. The three remaining counter channels will be assigned to
     the remaining configured scaler channels.

     The maximum count time is 286.33 minutes.  The MZ 8310 uses a 4MZ
     oscillator.  When counting to time, the resolution of the clock depends on
     the length of the count interval, as follows:

         0.00004    for   tt < 2.5 sec
         0.0004     for   tt < 25 sec
         0.004      for   tt < 250 sec
         0.04       for   tt < 2500 sec (41.67 min)
         0.262144   for   tt < 286.33 min

     When counting to monitor counts, the 0.04 second time base is used, and the
     value returned for the time channel will be corrected to account for the
     roll over that occurs every 655.36 seconds.
