BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS

     ccaa__ggeett((ii,, aa)) - Returns the 24-bit value read (using F = 0) from the ii-th (ii
          = 0, 1, ... ) CAMAC I/O device (from the ccoonnffiigg file) using subaddress
          aa.

     ccaa__ppuutt((xx,, ii,, aa)) - Writes the 24-bit value xx (using F = 16) to the ii-th (ii =
          0, 1, ... ) CAMAC I/O device (from the ccoonnffiigg file) using subaddress
          aa. Returns the value written.

     ccaa__ffnnaa((ff,, nn,, aa [[,, vv]])) - Sends the arbitrary FNA command to the module in
          slot nn. If the dataway command given by ff is a write function, the
          24-bit value to be written is contained in vv. If the dataway command
          given by ff is a read command, the function returns the 24-bit value
          obtained from the module.  The user should avoid issuing commands that
          would cause a LAM and should certainly avoid issuing commands to slots
          that are being used for motor or counter control by ssppeecc's internal
          hardware code.

     ccaa__ccnnttll((ccmmdd [[,, aarrgg]) - Performs the selected CAMAC crate command according
          to the parameter ccmmdd, as follows:

          ""ZZ"" or ""iinniitt"" - performs a crate initialize (reset).
          ""CC"" or ""cclleeaarr"" - performs a crate clear.
          ""iinnhhiibbiitt"" - set crate inhibit if aarrgg is 1 and clears crate inhibit if
               aarrgg is 0.

          During normal operation, you should not need to issue these commands.
          You should probably issue a rreeccoonnffiigg after sending a crate initialize
          or clear.

MULTIPLE CRATE CONTROLLERS

     As of ssppeecc release 5.06.02-1, up to four CAMAC crate controllers can be
     configured at a time.  Currently, use of more than one instance of a
     particular controller is supported only for the Jorway 73A, the KS-3929 and
     the DSP 6001 controller models.  Otherwise, only only one instance of a
     particular type or model of a controller can be used at a time.

     Also, the only CAMAC modules that currently can be installed in other than
     the first crate (crate 0) are the E250, KS-3655, KS-3610, KS-3112, KS-3116,
     KS-3195, QS-450, RTC-018 and XIA DXP-4C/4C2X MCA modules.

     In addition, the user-level functions ccaa__ggeett(()), ccaa__ppuutt(()), ccaa__ffnnaa(()) and
     ccaa__ccnnttll(()) currently only work with the first crate.

     The multiple crate support will be extended for multiple identical
     controllers, additional modules and to the user-level functions in the
     future as needed.

     To configure additional controllers from the eeddccoonnff configuration editor
     (invoked by the ccoonnffiigg macro), use ^^FF or ^^BB on the CAMAC entry of the
     IInterfaces screen.

     To configure modules in the additional crates, type CC from the CAMAC crate
     screen to cycle through the crates associated with each controller.

     For scaler modules installed in other than the first CAMAC crate, the crate
     number must be entered in the same field as the unit number on the SScaler
     screen of the configuration editor using the crate/unit notation, as in 1/0
     for crate 1, unit 0.

     For motor modules installed in other than the first CAMAC crate, the crate
     number is entered as [crate/]unit/channel in the unit/[module/]channel
     field of the motor screen.

     If only one crate is configured, the ccoonnffiigg file syntax is the same as
     before.  When multiple crates are configured, additional information
     specifying crate number for each module and controller is added to the
     ccoonnffiigg file.
