NAME
     cctt - count and print results

SYNOPSIS

     cctt [[ttiimmee]]

DESCRIPTION

     The cctt macro counts for ttiimmee. If ttiimmee is negative, counting is to monitor
     counts, otherwise ttiimmee specifies seconds.  If there is no argument, the
     count time is taken from the global symbol CCOOUUNNTT.  If interrupted with ^^CC,
     the counts accumulated to that time are shown.

EXAMPLE

     cctt 1100
