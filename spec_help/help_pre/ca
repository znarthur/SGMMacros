NAME
     ccaa - calculate motor settings for a given point in reciprocal space

SYNOPSIS

     ccaa HH KK LL

DESCRIPTION

     The ccaa macro prints out the calculated motor settings for the reciprocal
     space position given by the arguments HH, KK and LL.  After printing its
     information, the values in the AA[[]] array and the values of the reciprocal
     space coordinates are restored to the current diffractometer position.

     Use the ccaall macro to leave the calculated values in the AA[[]] array and in HH,
     KK and LL.

EXAMPLE

     ccaa 11 11 11
