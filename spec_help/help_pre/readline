readline                    GNU command line editing                    readline

NAME
     readline - command line recall and editing

DESCRIPTION

     The GNU rreeaaddlliinnee library or the BSD lliibbeeddiitt library may be optionally
     linked with ssppeecc during the ssppeecc installation.  When ssppeecc is linked with
     either of these libraries, the following command completion, history
     substitution and command line editing features become availble.

COMMAND COMPLETION

     The <<ttaabb>> key can be used to complete the current word being typed.  The
     completion is context sensitive.  If completion is asked for on the first
     word of a command, possible completions are all of ssppeecc's built-in keywords
     and currently defined macros.

     Possible completion on words following the commands llssddeeff, pprrddeeff and uunnddeeff
     are the currently defined macros.  Possible completion on words following
     the commands ssyymmss and uunngglloobbaall include all the current symbol names.
     Completion on words following llssccmmdd are the built-in keywords.  Possible
     completions to ssppeecc__ppaarr(( are the available ssppeecc__ppaarr(()) options.  In all
     other cases, possible completions on words following the first word of a
     command are all the file and directory names in the current directory.

     If only one completion is possible, typing the <<ttaabb>> key will generate the
     completion.  If a small number of completions are available, typing the
     <<ttaabb>> key twice will list them, followed by a redisplay of the current
     input line.  If a large number of completions are possible, typing the
     <<ttaabb>> will generate a prompt asking if all should be displayed.

TILDE EXPANSION

     The sequences ~~// and ~~aannyy__uusseerr// will be replaced by the full path names for
     the current user's and any user's home directory when those characters are
     used in the arguments to the ooppeenn(()), cclloossee(()), oonn(()), ooffff(()), ddooffiillee(()),
     qqddooffiillee(()), ffiillee__iinnffoo(()), cchhddiirr(()) and uunniixx(()) functions.  The same applies
     when the tilde-containing arguments are passed to the functions through
     macros, such as through the standard nneewwffiillee, ddoo, ccdd, uu, etc. macros.

     Note, as of ssppeecc release 5.04.04, tilde expansion is available whether or
     not ssppeecc is linked with the command-line editing libraries.

HISTORY SUBSTITUTION - EVENT SPECIFIERS

     All or part of a previous command can be recalled for the current command
     using a string starting with the !! event specifier character.  The
     following event specifiers may appear anywhere in the input line.

         !!!!  - The previous command.

         !!NN - Command number NN.

         !!--NN - The NNth previous command.

         !!ssttrriinngg - The most recent command starting with ssttrriinngg.

         !!??ssttrriinngg[[??]]  - The most recent command containing ssttrriinngg. The trailing
              ?? is optional at the end of a line.

HISTORY SUBSTITUTION - WORD DESIGNATORS

     Individual words from previous commands can be recalled by adding a word
     designator to the event specifier.  A colon (::) separates the two
     components and can be omitted if the word designator begins with the
     characters ^^, $$, ** or %%.  Words are numbered from the beginning of the
     line, starting with a 0 (zero).

         00 - The 0th word.

         NN - The NNth word.

         ^^ - Word 1.  !!^^ refers to word 1 of the previous command.

         $$ - The last word.  !!$$ refers to the last word of the previous command.

         %% - The word most recently matched by a ??ssttrriinngg??.

         NN--MM - A range of words; --NN Abbreviates 00--NN.

         ** - All of the words, except the 0th.  This is the same as 11--$$. If
              there is just one word (the 0th) in the event, an empty string is
              substituted.

         NN** - Same as NN--$$.

         NN-- - Same as NN--$$, but doesn't include the last word.

HISTORY SUBSTITUTION - MODIFIERS

     One or more modifiers may follow the optional word designator, each
     preceded by a ::, as follows:

         ## - The entire command line typed so far.

         hh - Remove a trailing path name component of the form //ppaatthhnnaammee.

         rr - Remove a trailing suffix of the form ..ssuuffffiixx.

         ee - Remove all but the suffix.

         tt - Remove all leading path name components.

         ss//lleefftt//rriigghhtt[[//]] - Substitute the first occurrence of the string lleefftt
              with the string rriigghhtt. The pattern delimiter can be any character.
              An && character in rriigghhtt is replaced by lleefftt, unless the && is
              preceeded by a single backslash.  The trailing delimiter is
              optional if rriigghhtt is at the end of the line.

         gg - When used with ss, apply the substitution to each occurrence of the
              string lleefftt.

         pp - Print the new command but do not execute it.

     The usage ^^lleefftt^^rriigghhtt^^ is shorthand for !!!!::ss//lleefftt//rriigghhtt//.

COMMAND LINE EDITING

     The following special keys can be used to recall previous command lines and
     to modify the current command line.  In addition to the control keys
     described below, the up and down arrow keys move through the history, while
     the left and right arrow keys move the cursor within the currently
     displayed line.

     The command names listed for readline and libedit are the names you would
     use in an optional key-bindings file.  See the documentation for readline
     or libedit for information on setting up their respective key bindings
     files.  ssppeecc will arrange for a key-bindings file named ..ssppeecc__kkeeyyss in the
     ssppeecc user's home directory to be loaded, if it exists.

NOTES

     With the optional history libraries, the !! character must be preceded by a
     \\ when it is typed from the keyboard and is not intended to be part of a
     history substitution.

DISTRIBUTION

     The readline library is included with most modern LLiinnuuxx distributions.  In
     addition, sources can be retrieved from _f_t_p_:_/_/_f_t_p_._g_n_u_._o_r_g_/_g_n_u_/_r_e_a_d_l_i_n_e and
     installed on any platform supported by ssppeecc.  ssppeecc should link with all
     current and previous releases of readline.  ssppeecc is known to link with
     readline versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.2a and 4.3.

     A prebuilt version of the NetBSD libedit library is included with the ssppeecc
     distribution in the lliibbeeddiitt subdirectory.  The official source respository
     for the NetBSD version is at
     _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_c_v_s_w_e_b_._n_e_t_b_s_d_._o_r_g_/_b_s_d_w_e_b_._c_g_i_/_s_r_c_/_l_i_b_/_l_i_b_e_d_i_t.  Portable versions
     configurable for other platforms are available from
     _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_w_w_w_._t_h_r_y_s_o_e_e_._d_k_/_e_d_i_t_l_i_n_e, although that site doesn't always have the
     most recent version.  The source for the prebuilt version included with the
     ssppeecc distribution is available at _c_e_r_t_i_f_._c_o_m_/_d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d_s_/_e_x_t_r_a_s.
