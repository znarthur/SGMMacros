NAME
     help format - help file format conventions and syntax

SPECIAL NOTE FOR ssppeecc RELEASE 6

     The syntax described below is no longer used by the standard ssppeecc help
     utility.  With ssppeecc release 6, help files are now authored using
     reStructuredText (reST) format.  For terminal display, the reST files are
     converted to an _n_r_o_f_f format, then processed using _m_a_n-page type macros for
     display.

     Files residing in the SSPPEECCDD//hheellpp directory that use the following
     directives will be processed using _g_r_o_f_f (or _n_r_o_f_f) with a compatible macro
     set.  The ssppeecc program itself no longers contains built-in code for
     formatting help files.

INTRODUCTION

     This document describes the formatting syntax and conventions used with the
     ssppeecc and CC--PPLLOOTT help files.  The formatting syntax uses the conventions of
     the traditional UNIX text formatters (nnrrooffff, ttrrooffff, ddiittrrooffff, etc.),
     although only a small subset of the formatting directives are supported by
     the ssppeecc and CC--PPLLOOTT built-in formatting.  The supported directives are
     described below.

     The distributions of ssppeecc and CC--PPLLOOTT include utilities for preparing both
     PostScript and HTML (hyper text markup language) versions of the help files
     using either the standard ddiittrrooffff or the GNU ggrrooffff packages.

FORMATTING COMMANDS

     Input text that has a dot on the first line is a formatting command.
     Unrecognized commands are ignored in ssppeecc and CC--PPLLOOTT.

     The following commands are supported:

     ..\\"" - Begins a comment.  The rest of the text on the line is ignored.

     ..bbpp - Begins a new page.

     ..BBPP - Same as above.

     ..nnee NN - Indicates NN lines are needed on the current page.  If there isn't
          enough room on the current page, a new page is started.

     ..sspp NN - spaces NN lines.  Without an argument, one line is skipped.  The
          argument may contain a decimal point and a unit indicator for the
          benefit of nnrrooffff/ttrrooffff, although for ssppeecc and CC--PPLLOOTT, only the integer
          part of the argument is used.

     ..ttaa NN - Start words every NN letters, somewhat like using tabs.

     ..bbrr - Causes a line break.  The current line is finished and a new line is
          started.

     ..nnff - Switch to no-fill mode.  Each newline in the input causes a newline
          in the output.

     ..ffii - Switch to fill mode.  Words are collected from the input until a full
          line of output is available.

     ..TTHH nnaammee ccaatteeggoorryy ddaattee SSCCCCSS__iinnffoo - Should be on the first line of a help
          file.  The arguments are used in the page header (and footer, when
          printed) and are, respectively, the name of the help file, the
          category (such as macro, function, reference, etc.), the date the file
          was last revised and source-code control information.

     ..SSHH - Does a subhead.  There can't be more than six arguments, although you
          can use double quotes to put more than one word in an argument.
          Subheads are placed all the way to the left of the page.

     ..HHPP NN - Starts a hanging paragraph.  The optional argument NN specifies the
          indent level.  The default is 0.

     ..hhpp NN - Can be used within a ..HHPP block to increase or decrease the indent.
          The optional argument NN specifies the indent level.  This command will
          skip a line.

     ..PPPP - Starts a paragraph.

     ..LLPP - Same as above.

     ..((LL  FF NN II - Starts a no-fill block.  The optional argument FF indicates the
          font to use and may be RR, II, CC, BB or OO.  (See below for a description
          of the font code letters.)  The optional argument NN is the number of
          lines needed.  If there is not enough room to print that many lines on
          the current page, a new page will be started.  The optional argument II
          is the number of spaces of extra indentation to add.

     ..))LL - Ends the no-fill block started by ..((LL.

     ..QQ - Put quotation marks around arguments.  If no arguments, put quotation
          marks around text on next input line.

     ..NNEE - Only relevant for screen displays, this command indicates the screen
          should not be erased before displaying the first page.

     ## - Starts a comment if its the first character on a line.  The rest of the
          text on the line is ignored.  This comment notation is only for files
          that will not be run off using nnrrooffff/ttrrooffff.

     ..BBLL - Begin a list of items.

     ..EELL - Ends a list of items.

     ..LLII iitteemm - Adds iitteemm to a list of items.  For HTML documents, one list
          items appears per line of output.  For non-HTML documents, list items
          are separated by tabs, and will fill the row according to the current
          tab stops.

     ..DDLL ++ or ..DDLL -- - For HTML output, indicates the start or end of a
          definition block.

     ..DDDD tteexxtt - For HTML output, indicates the start of a definition.  For the
          other formats, the optional argument is simply copied verbatim.

     ..HHRR tteexxtt[[ CC [[ UURRLL ]]]] - For HTML output, creates a hypertext link.  If one
          or two arguments are present, names the link tteexxtt..hhttmmll.  If the second
          argument is CC, outputs tteexxtt in Courier font.  If the third argument is
          present, uses that as the URL link.  For non-HTML formats, the text is
          copied verbatim in the indicated font.

FONT CONTROL

     The help files use the following fonts for the purposes indicated.  In the
     printed documentation, the New Century Schoolbook typeface is used for the
     Roman, italic and bold fonts.  When used with ssppeecc and CC--PPLLOOTT, the
     directives to switch to bold, italic or one of the Courier typefaces result
     in highlighted text on a video terminal.

     Roman (R) - Used for normal text.

     IIttaalliicc (I) - Used for file and path names, including system commands, along
     with book titles, etc.

     BBoolldd (B) - Used for section heads.  Occasionally used for emphasis.
     Sometimes used to display arguments to system commands.

     CCoouurriieerr (C) - Used to represent literal text that might be output by the
     computer program or might be typed by a user at the keyboard.

     CCoouurriieerr BBoolldd (CB) - Occasionally used to distinguish text a user types from
     text output by the computer.

     CCoouurriieerr OObblliiqquuee (O) - Used to represent variable computer text, such as the
     argument to a function.

     "Quoted Text" (Q) - Not really a font, but used to place double quotes
     around a bit of text.

     All the fonts, except Roman, display as highlighted text on the video
     terminal.

     The formatting commands:

         ..BB ..CC ..II ..OO

     put their arguments in the associated font.  If there are no arguments to
     the above commands, the next line of input is put in that font.

     The formatting commands:

        ..RRBB  ..BBRR  ..IIRR  ..CCRR  ..OORR  ..CCBB
        ..RRII  ..BBII  ..IIBB  ..CCII  ..OOCC
        ..RRCC       ..IICC  ..CCOO
        ..RROO

     place the first argument in the first font, the second argument in the
     second font and append an optional third argument in the regular text font,
     except for ..CCBB, which uses Courier Bold and Roman for the two fonts.  The
     space characters between the arguments are removed.  Use double quotes to
     include space characters within arguments.  A space character is added
     after the last argument.  The formatting commands:

        ..rrbb       ..iirr
        ..rrii            ..ccii  ..oocc
        ..rrcc       ..iicc  ..ccoo
        ..rroo

     work as above, except a space characters is not appended after the last
     argument.

     The @@ symbol is used in the help file sources to represent literal double
     quote characters, which makes it easier to insert literal double quote
     characters into formatting command arguments.  To enter a literal @@ use
     both a backslash and the troff ..ttrr directive, as in:

        ..ttrr @@@@
        aa lliitteerraall \\@@ aappppeeaarrss
        ..ttrr @@""

SPECIAL CHARACTER SEQUENCES

     The following special character sequences are recognized:

         \\""         A double quote
         \\&&         A zero-width space
         \\00         A digit-width space
         \\||         A sixth-em space (no space on screen)
         \\((****       An asterisk (*)
         \\((hhyy       A hyphen (-)
         \\((mmuu       The multiplication sign (x)
         \\((ssppaaccee))   An unpaddable space
         \\**((CCPP      The string CC--PPLLOOTT
         \\**((SSPP      The string ssppeecc
         \\**((UUNN      The string UNIX
         \\--         A minus sign (-)
         \\@@         An @ sign
         \\\\         A back slash
         \\ee         A back slash
         \\ff11        Switch to font R
         \\ffCC        Switch to font C
         \\ffPP        Switch to previous font
         \\ff\\**((##CC    Switch to font C
         \\ff\\**((##II    Switch to font I
         \\ff\\**((##OO    Switch to font O

HINTS

     Since the ..iiff command is not recognized by the ssppeecc and CC--PPLLOOTT built-in
     formatter, use the command ..iiff tt ...... to insert formatting directives to be
     executed only when the help files are being printed with ttrrooffff.
