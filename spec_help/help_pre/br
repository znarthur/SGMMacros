br                                    macro                                   br

NAME
     bbrr and uubbrr - move to the reciprocal space coordinates (HHKKLL)

SYNOPSIS

     bbrr HH KK LL
     uubbrr HH KK LL

DESCRIPTION

     The bbrr macro is used to move the diffractometer to the reciprocal space
     coordinates given by HH, KK and LL.

     The uubbrr macro also moves the diffractometer, but provides an updated
     display of the motor positions and corresponding reciprocal space
     coordinates while the motors are moving.  The update interval, in seconds,
     is set by the global variable UUPPDDAATTEE.

     bbrr is synonymous with mmkk.

EXAMPLE

     bbrr 00 00 11
