debug                                 macro                                debug

NAME
     ddeebbuugg - set debugging level of diagnostic messages

SYNOPSIS

     ddeebbuugg lleevveell

DESCRIPTION

     A value assigned to the built-in global variable DDEEBBUUGG enables various
     levels of debugging message output.  A debugging level can also be set on
     startup with the --dd option.  The ddeebbuugg standard macro can also select a
     debugging level.

     The following values when added together set the debugging level.  Decimal
     values are shown in the first column, hexadecimal in the second.  (Adding
     hexadecimal values together is easier when higher order bits are involved!)

             1      0x1        Show input tokens during parsing.
             2      0x2        Show node execution while running.
             4      0x4        Show node allocate and free.
             8      0x8        Show symbol table creation and lookup.
             16     0x10       Show values get and set.
             32     0x20       Show miscellaneous memory-related info.
             64     0x40       Show hardware related info.
             128    0x80       Show additional hardware related info.
             256    0x100      Show macro substitution.
             512    0x200      Show memory allocate and free.
             1024   0x400      Show input after macro expansion.
             2048   0x800      Print warning messages.
             4096   0x1000     Show some lower level hardware info.
             8192   0x2000     Show data array allocation.
             etc.   0x4000     Show signal blocking.
                    0x8000     Show low level hardware info.
                    0x10000    Show input file queuing and shell commands.
                    0x20000    Show readable runtime debugging.
                    0x40000    Print input context on execution-time errors.
                    0x80000    Show sleeps.
                    0x100000   Show thread locking (enormous amount of output).
                    0x200000   Show state changes (not normally enabled).
                    0x400000   Use hexadecimal for socket/serial debugging output.
                    0x800000   Show server/client socket messages.

     When invoking the ddeebbuugg macro, an argument of ++vvaalluuee or --vvaalluuee adds or
     removes vvaalluuee from the current level.

     For hardware debugging, the following levels may be useful.  Level 128
     generally displays higher level messages associated with hardware
     controllers.  Level 64 displays lower level serial and socket messages.
     Level 4096 shows more detailed messages for some protocols, including the
     server mode messages between ssppeecc servers and clients.  The detailed socket
     level messages used during ssppeecc server/client communication are only shown
     if level 0x800000 is active.  Including level 0x400000 with level 64 or
     level 0x800000 will select a hex dump format for the low level serial and
     socket messages.

     Level 0x40000 shows input context on execution errors and can be helpful to
     help pin down syntax errors in macros.

     Other levels, such as those that show memory allocation (512), sleeps
     (0x80000) and thread locking (0x100000), produce copious output and are
     likely only useful to those working on the ssppeecc code.

     Debugging mode can generate a large amount of output that will appear not
     only on the screen but also in any open output files, including the data
     file.  However, if a special debugging log file is opened, the debugging
     output will only appear in that file, not on the screen and not in any
     other files.  A debugging log file is an output file that is named ddlloogg or
     ends with the string ..ddlloogg.  For example:

        ffoonn hhddww..ddlloogg
        ddeebbuugg 119922
