newfile                               macro                              newfile

NAME
     nneewwffiillee - data file management

SYNOPSIS

     nneewwffiillee [[ffiillee__nnaammee]] [[ccuurrrreenntt__ssccaann__nnuummbbeerr]]

DESCRIPTION

     The nneewwffiillee macro is used to initialize a new data file or reopen an old
     data file.  You might open a new data file for each new sample or each new
     experiment.  There is no specific limit to the number of scans you can put
     in a data file, although for practical considerations, you may want to
     start a new file after you have accumulated one or two hundred scans or
     when the size of the data file makes it unwieldy.

     If ffiillee__nnaammee doesn't contain the // character, and if there is a directory
     named ddaattaa in the current directory, the file is opened in that directory.
     If you give nnuullll as a file name, //ddeevv//nnuullll is used.  Otherwise the file
     name or path name given by ffiillee__nnaammee is used.

     The next scan written to the file will have scan number ccuurrrreenntt__ssccaann__nnuummbbeerr
     +1.

     You can use nneewwffiillee to reopen an existing data file.  New scans will be
     placed at then end of the file.  You can use command uu ggrreepp ##SS ffiillee__nnaammee to
     find the last scan number in an existing file.

GLOBALS

     DDAATTAAFFIILLEE - Global variable holding name of the current data file.  Its
          value is written in the data file header preceded by ##FF.

     SSCCAANN__NN - Global variable holding current scan number.  Its value is written
          in the data file scan headers preceded by ##SS.

     EEPPOOCCHH - Constant variable holding the time at which the data file was
          opened.  Its value is written in the data file header preceded by ##EE.

     TTIITTLLEE - Global variable written as a comment in the data file header.  Its
          value is an arbitrary string set by the user.
