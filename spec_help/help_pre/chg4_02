NAME
     changes - highlights of modifications for ssppeecc release 4.02

RELEASE 4.02.04

     These notes summarize the cumulative changes made for ssppeecc release 4.02.04
     as of May 12, 1997.

New Tty Control In ttttyy__mmoovvee(()) and ttttyy__ffmmtt(())
     All the tty attribute-control strings available with the ttttyy__ccnnttll(())
     function can now be included in special character sequences (as in \\[[mmdd]]
     and \\[[mmee]] to start and end bold mode, for example) in the strings passed to
     the ttttyy__mmoovvee(()) and ttttyy__ffmmtt(()) functions.

New eenndd__mmaacc Built-In Macro
     If a macro named eenndd__mmaacc is defined, its contents will be executed when
     ssppeecc exits in normal fashion.  The eenndd__mmaacc macro will not be run if ssppeecc is
     killed or exits due to a fatal error.  If there is an error while executing
     the commands in eenndd__mmaacc, ssppeecc will exit anyway, and the eenndd__mmaacc macro will
     remain defined.

2D Associative Arrays Enhanced
     The following syntax using 2D associative arrays is now available:

        tteesstt[[""iinnddeexx11""]][[""vvaall00""]] == ""ddaattaa00""
        tteesstt[[""iinnddeexx11""]][[""vvaall22""]] == ""ddaattaa22""
        tteesstt[[""iinnddeexx22""]][[""vvaall11""]] == ""ddaattaa11""
        tteesstt[[""iinnddeexx22""]][[""vvaall33""]] == ""ddaattaa33""

        ffoorr ((ii iinn tteesstt[[""iinnddeexx11""]]))
                pprriinntt ii,, tteesstt[[""iinnddeexx11""]][[ii]]

        iiff ((""vvaall22"" iinn tteesstt[[""iinnddeexx11""]]))
                pprriinntt ""yyeess""

GPIB and CAMAC Sharing Fixed
     The HP SICL GPIB controller can now be configured as a shared controller.
     GPIB problems that occurred when the KS 3929 SCSI-to-CAMAC controller was
     configured as shared but the GPIB controller was not have been fixed.

Fixed Motion Bug With Large Backlash and Move Magnitudes
     A very old bug, where motor backlash movements didn't get done when the
     product of the backlash magnitude and the move magnitude exceeded the
     maximum value for a long integer, has been fixed.

Code For Princeton Instruments ST116 PDA Fixed
     Support for the ST116 PDA has been updated to work with ssppeecc release 4.
     The mmccaa__ggeett(()) routine now returns the number of points read, as is the
     current convention.  The status byte sent by the instrument at the end of
     the data stream and formerly returned by mmccaa__ggeett(()) is now available using
     mmccaa__ppaarr((""ssttaattuuss__bbyyttee"")).

Command Completion Tuned
     ssppeecc now does context-dependent command completion for the llssddeeff, uunnddeeff,
     pprrddeeff, llssccmmdd, ssyymmss and uunngglloobbaall commands when linked with the GNU readline
     library.  (Command completion lists the possible valid completions or fills
     in a unique completion when the <<ttaabb>> key is pressed after partial input.)

xx1111ffiilltt Core Dump Fixed
     A bug that sometimes caused a core dump from the X11 filter program xx1111ffiilltt
     when DDIISSPPLLAAYY could not be opened has been fixed.

RELEASE 4.02.03

     These notes summarize the cumulative changes made for ssppeecc release 4.02.03
     as of April 18, 1997.

Wizard Password Can Be In a SSPPEECCDD//ppaasssswwdd File
     The ssppeecc wizard password can now be located in a file named ppaasssswwdd in the
     ssppeecc auxiliary file directory (useful if shadow passwords are used, as the
     shadow file containing the encrypted password can be read only by root).
     The format of the file is the same as in the conventional ppaasssswwdd file,
     although this file need only contain the one line for the ssppeeccwwiizz user.
     The wizard password is used with the ^^WW command in the eeddccoonnff configuration
     editor and with wizard mode with the ssppeecc__ppaarr((""ssppeeccwwiizz"",, 11)) function.

The uucctt and ccoouunntteerrss Macros Fixed Up
     The ccoouunntteerrss macro will now check that the scaler channels are within
     range.  The uucctt macro will now print only the first six counters, if there
     are more than six counters configured.  Note, the uuccttnn macro can provide an
     updated display of more than six counters.

Support For Bit 3 VME Workstation Controllers Fleshed Out
     ssppeecc now supports access to the full A32 and dual-port memory address
     space, including DMA transfers to and from ssppeecc data arrays, with the Bit 3
     Model 466-1/467-1 VME controllers on Sun platforms and the Model 487-1 VME
     controller on HP platforms.

Support For Princeton Instruments CCD Camera Controllers Improved
     The code for the Princeton Instruments CCD camera controllers has been
     revised a bit.  KKiinneettiiccss mode is now supported.  The iimmaaggee__ppaarr(()) function
     argument ""kkiinneettiiccss"" is used to turn the mode on or off.  The argument
     ""kkiinnwwiinnssiizzee"" is used to set the number of rows in the kinetics-mode window.

Bug Fixed With 0xFF Printed After Parsing Macro Functions
     Odd behavior, introduced with the recent fix of an obscure bug dealing with
     parsing macro functions, where a character with ASCII value 255 would be
     sent to the screen after a macro function was parsed, has been corrected.

RELEASE 4.02.02

     These notes summarize the cumulative changes made for ssppeecc release 4.02.02
     as of March 31, 1997.

New vvmmee__mmoovvee(()) Function
     A new vvmmee__mmoovvee(()) function copies data between VME A32 address space and
     ssppeecc data arrays.  See the _v_m_e help file for more information.

Macro Source Files Displayed With pprrddeeff
     The pprrddeeff command will now display (as a comment) the name of the source
     file in which the macro was defined.  This feature, which is on by default,
     can be disabled using ssppeecc__ppaarr((""sshhooww__pprrddeeff__ffiilleess"",, 00)).

Can Now Configure Parity For rraaww Serial Interface
     The options rraaww eevveennpp and rraaww ooddddpp can now be selected on the Interfaces
     screen of the configuration editor for generic serial devices.

Bug with ccddeeff(()) Fixed
     Using the chained macro function ccddeeff(()) with just one argument will create
     an empty macro with the given name.  If the macro already exists, it will
     do nothing.  Previously, such usage was undefined.

ffiillee__iinnffoo(()) Bug Fixed
     A bug with the new ffiillee__iinnffoo(()) function, where use with a single argument
     to test for the existence of a file could result in a segmentation
     violation, has been fixed.

Bit 3 VME Support on Sun Platforms
     The Bit 3 S-BUS VME controllers for SunOS 4.x and Solaris 2.x platforms are
     now supported.

New Feature For NSK Motor Controller
     The function mmoottoorr__ppaarr((mmnnee,, ""rreeaadd"")) will now return the strings read for
     the NSK motor controller.

Tweak Macro Enhanced
     You can now change the tweak step size in the ttww macro by typing a
     numerical value at the ttww prompt.

More Flexible ESRF Format Read
     The ffmmtt__rreeaadd(()) function for the ESRF data-file format now works with
     headers that are not exactly 1024 bytes long.

Additions To ggmmccii Geometry
     The ggmmccii geometry, as used at CEA in Grenoble, now includes the latest
     revisions from the users there.

RELEASE 4.02.01

     These notes summarize the cumulative changes made for ssppeecc release 4.02.01
     as of March 9, 1997.

New Default X11 Plot Titles
     ssppeecc now sets the default X11 plot title to the name by name of the running
     program followed by the filter number as in ffoouurrcc 11, ffoouurrcc 22, ssiixxcc 11, etc.
     The plot title can still be changed using pplloott__ccnnttll((""ttiittllee==......"")).

Improved File-Write Error Handling
     When there is a write error on output to a file, ssppeecc will turn off further
     output to the file until there is a oonn(()) or ooppeenn(()) call.  That gives the
     user an opportunity to cclloossee(()) the file if no further output is possible,
     due perhaps to a down NFS connection.  Previously, ssppeecc would continue
     attempts to flush any pending output, even after write errors.

New xxxxxx__ppaarr((...... ""ddeevviiccee__iidd"")) Partially Implemented
     The mmoottoorr__ppaarr(()), ccoouunntteerr__ppaarr(()), mmccaa__ppaarr(()), mmccaa__ssppaarr(()) and iimmaaggee__ppaarr(())
     functions all now take a new ""ddeevviiccee__iidd"" parameter.  In the case of ESRF
     device server devices, the return value is the string name of the imported
     device.  For some ESRF devices, the return value will be ""??""  if the device
     was not successfully imported.  For non-ESRF devices, the return value may
     be ""??"" or some other identifier such as GPIB address or CAMAC slot.

eexxiitt Bug In Macro Functions Fixed
     A bug, whereby an eexxiitt command in a macro function didn't reset to command
     level, has been fixed.

Mnemonic Checking Fix Fixed
     The 4.01.15 fix to prevent the same mnemonic being used for both a motor
     and a counter led to some problems when restarting ssppeecc after it terminated
     abnormally.  Now the mnemonics are kept straight.

ssccaannss..44 Fix For @@AA Array Data
     A bug in ssccaannss..44..cc, where \\ continuation lines of @@AA array data were not
     ignored when the MCA data wasn't asked for, has been fixed.

X25 ssuurrff Modifications
     The ssuurrff geometry for the NSLS X25 diffractometer will now work with either
     a one- or two-motor detector-height stages.

Distinct Configuration For NI GPIB-ENET
     There is now a distinct configuration choice for the National Instruments
     GPIB-ENET controller on platforms that support that device.  With the
     GPIB-ENET configuration selected, ssppeecc will block keyboard signals during
     calls to the subroutines in the NI cciibb..oo module, as experience has shown
     those routines are not rebust with respect to signals.

More Changes For the MM2500/ITL09 Motor Controllers
     On the advice of the manufacturer, ssppeecc now sleeps for 100 msec before
     reading a response to a command sent to the MM2500/ITL09 motor controllers.
     Perhaps that will help.
