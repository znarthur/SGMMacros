NAME
     install - ssppeecc installation procedure

DESCRIPTION

     These notes describe how to download and install ssppeecc.

PREPARATION

     To helps keep the files associated with ssppeecc organized, CSS recommends
     creating a user account on your machine named ssppeeccaaddmm that will own the
     ssppeecc files.  We also recommend that the distribution files associated with
     each version of ssppeecc be placed in a subdirectory named after the release
     number in the home directory of ssppeeccaaddmm.  For example, if installing ssppeecc
     release 5.09.02-2 and if the home directory of ssppeeccaaddmm is //hhoommee//ssppeeccaaddmm,
     then the ssppeecc distribution might be placed in a directory named
     //hhoommee//ssppeeccaaddmm//ssppeecc55..0099..0022. The downloaded distribution "tarball" files
     might be stored in a separate directory, such as //hhoommee//ssppeeccaaddmm//ddiisstt//.

DOWNLOADING

     ssppeecc is distributed as a ttaarr format file, usually retrieved from the
     certif.com server using http.  One generally receives emailed instructions
     on the exact path name to access a particular ssppeecc distribution from the
     http server.  Distributions can only be retrieved by name, as the contents
     of the distribution directory are hidden.

     Assuming the recommended locations, the usual procedure for downloading the
     ssppeecc distribution is as follows:

         ccdd //hhoommee//ssppeeccaaddmm//ddiisstt
         wwggeett hhttttpp::////cceerrttiiff..ccoomm//ccssss__ddiisstt//ssppeecc__ddiissttvveerr..ttaarr

     The ddiissttvveerr part of the file name will be unique to each download and will
     include the release version number.  If you don't have the wwggeett utility,
     you can try to save the file from a web browser.

EXTRACTING

     Use commands along the following lines to extract the ssppeecc distribution
     from the ttaarr file:

        ccdd //hhoommee//ssppeeccaaddmm
        mmkkddiirr ssppeecc55..0099..0022             ((ffoorr rreelleeaassee 55..0099..0022))
        ccdd ssppeecc55..0099..0022
        ttaarr xxvvff ....//ddiisstt//ssppeecc__ddiissttvveerr..ttaarr

INSTALLING

     When updating a previous installation of ssppeecc, copy the iinnssttaallll__ddaattaa file
     from the previous distribution directory to the current distribution
     directory.  That will save having to retype the same responses to the
     configuration questions.

     On a PC, with a hardware configuration that uses ISA or PCI cards, the
     IInnssttaallll program needs to be run as the super user (root).  In other cases,
     it isn't necessary to run as root, but the user running the script needs to
     have permission to write files in the target directories.

     Some of the following IInnssttaallll options may be of interest.

         --dd   Use the default parameters from iinnssttaallll__ddaattaa
         --pp   Do a partial installation (geometry-dependent stuff)
         --ss   Just compile the geometry target
         --SS   Do not require root access to install

     To run the script, type IInnssttaallll [[ooppttiioonnss]] (or ..//IInnssttaallll [[ooppttiioonnss]] if the
     current directory isn't in your path).

     The _c_o_n_f_i_g___a_d_m help file explains how to setup up the site configuration.
     In particular, sections at the end of the help file describe how to set up
     special lliinnkkeedd ccoonnffiigguurraattiioonnss and eexxttrraa pprrootteeccttiioonn features.

     You should also check the RREEAADDMMEE files in the ssppeecc distribution directory
     and the aauuxx subdirectory for additional information.
