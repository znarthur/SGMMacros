NAME
     changes - highlights of modifications for ssppeecc release 2.5

DESCRIPTION

     These notes summarize the modifications made for ssppeecc release 2.5, as
     finalized on May 11, 1988.

CHANGES

     Each motor now has three levels of security: 1) no protection, 2) limits
     cannot be changed and 3) motor cannot be moved.

     When using edconf to alter the configuration file, limits no longer track
     changes to the accumulator, however they still follow changes to the dial
     setting.

     The name of the standard macro file has been changed from
     //uussrr//lliibb//ssppeecc..dd//ssppeecc..mmaacc to //uussrr//lliibb//ssppeecc..dd//ssttaannddaarrdd..mmaacc.

     The DSP CAMAC driver has been fixed to enable slot 16 to work.  In
     addition, each time a process opens the driver when no other process has it
     open, a CAMAC ZZ (initialization command) is issued.

     A new macro wwmm, ""wwhheerree mmoottoorr"", prints positions and limits for up to six
     motors.

     A new macro vvii invokes the editor called vvii.

     A new macro mmaaiill invokes the mailer called mmaaiillxx.

     A new macro bbuugg lets the user enter a message that is then mailed to the
     administrator, ssppeecc__aaddmm.

     A new macro sspplloott plots the current data on the video screen.

     The geometry status macros wwhh, ccaa, ccii, etc., will now only print the
     positions of the four-circle motors.

     MMOOTTOORRSS is now a built-in symbol, automatically set to the number of
     configured motors when the ccoonnffiigg file is read.

     On first reading of the standard macros, if the four-circle motors are not
     configured in the standard positions (0-3), the motor indirection array
     (__AA[[]]) is automatically initialized.

     The four-circle diffractometer macro set and C code has been improved,
     including better diagnostics when trying to go to unreachable positions and
     bug fixes.  The RReeffeerreennccee MMaannuuaall now contains a complete description of the
     four-circle interface.  Among the new four-circle macros to set geometry
     parameters (each will prompt if invoked without arguments) are sseettmmooddee to
     set the mode, sseettsseeccttoorr to set the sector, sseettllaatt to set the crystal
     lattice parameters and sseettaazz to set the azimuthal reference vector.

     The state file is no longer saved if the user exits using ^^ZZ.

     The plotting interface has been revised.  Consult the RReeffeerreennccee MMaannuuaall for
     details.

     The wwaaiitt(()) function can now be invoked to return a value indicating if any
     asynchronous activity is going on.

     New built-in functions eexxpp1100((xx)) and ppooww((xx,, yy)) are available.  The former
     returns 10 to the xx, the latter, xx to the yy.
